<head><hi rend="bold">FOREWORD</hi></head>
<p>The building of Central Park according to the vision of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux is one of the great political and cultural achievements of the American people. That the democratic experiment of a public park had succeeded so well and for so long seemed to constitute a mandate for its preservation and rebuilding in <date when="1979">1979</date> when Mayor <name type="pname">Edward I. Koch</name> appointed me to be the first Central Park administrator and Commissioner <name type="pname">Gordon J. Davis</name> helped me to found the Central Park Conservancy. As the studies of the Con-<lb/>
servancy staff and consultants on the park's management and restoration plan went forward in the early <date when="1980">1980</date>s, I wanted to understand better the landscape tradition of which Central Park is a part and to learn more about the history of landscape design that preceded and followed it.</p>
<p>During this period, I read books and articles that were beginning to appear in the area of garden history, thanks in part to the work of Elizabeth Blair MacDougall, former director of the program of landscape studies at Dumbarton Oaks in <name type="place">Washington</name>, D.C., and her successor, <name type="pname">John Dixon Hunt</name>, who now serves as the chairman of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning at the University of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>. As editor of the international quarterly <hi rend="italic">Studies in the History of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, formerly the Journal of Garden History,</hi> Professor Hunt has actively promoted the historiography of landscape design both through his own work and in the scholarship that he has encouraged with the symposia he has organized, the papers he has published, and the books he has encouraged and authored. Because of the work of <name type="pname">MacDougall</name>, <name type="pname">Hunt</name>, and several other contemporary landscape historians, including <name type="pname">David Coffin</name>, who pioneered the study of landscape design as a branch of art history at Princeton University, facile assumptions have been overturned and understanding deepened in a heretofore barely considered field of serious study. Further, archaeologists and historians have brought to light much new information that deserves to be synthesized in a comprehensive survey that will allow a comparative analysis of styles and periods and provide an understanding of the cultural values that have informed landscape design in different times and places.</p>
<p>As serious scholarship was emerging in the area of landscape studies, new works on urbanism were also being published. The late Spiro Kostof in particular stands out as a writer who stimulated understanding of the design of cities as large-scale, long-term landscape projects. Reading his works and those of other authors, I began to see a reciprocity of influence between cities, parks, and gardens and to understand that in addition to being part of a continuum of design sensibility, all three categories of landscape were almost always subject to a prevailing Zeitgeist.</p>
<p>Everywhere and always humanity's desire to reflect cosmological understanding, to perfect nature, and to order the physical circumstances of life is strong. To understand better the cultural ethos reflected in the land-<lb/>
scapes I wished to describe I have read history, philosophy, science, and certain important works of literature. Readings in these areas, I believe, reinforce the assumption that everything we see reflecting human presence in nature has its origins in the mind and its cultural constructs. Whether reflecting deep religious convictions, economic motives, or passing fancies, art is always imbedded in the prevailing cultural values of a certain group of people at a particular period in history. Thus, ideological forces guide the minds and hands of those who shape space and, through design, give meaning to place. This representation of ideas in the built environment occurs sometimes with intent but often unconsciously. Thus, so-called vernacular landscapes have as much cultural significance as artfully contrived ones for those who care to observe and reflect upon the scenery of everyday life.</p>
<p>In making this intellectual journey I have had the encouragement of family members and the friends who have heard, read, and constructively criticized my thoughts and ideas. First and foremost, I wish to thank my husband, Ted, who has deferred alternative vacation itineraries in favor of travel excursions in the service of this book and who has listened to many groping ideas and glimmers of understanding along the way. In addition, I owe special thanks to four distinguished historians whose friendship and belief in my project's value have
<pb n="17"/>
<pb n="17" type="orig"/>
assisted me greatly. They are <name type="pname">Frances H. Kennedy</name>, <name type="pname">Roger G. Kennedy</name>, <name type="pname">Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz</name>, and <name type="pname">Daniel Horowitz</name>. In particular, <name type="pname">Frances Kennedy</name>, who is also a noted conservationist, gave me invaluable advice and introductions to others who were helpful. <name type="pname">Helen Horowitz</name> provided firm encouragement, insist-<lb/>
ing that I continue working toward publication at the point when the effort seemed most daunting. Then, as the book neared completion, she read the manuscript and made several helpful suggestions that improved its structure and narrative flow. I also thank my friend Ned O'Gorman for reading several chapters with a poet's ear for language and a gardener's eye for landscape.</p>
<p>Another friend, Carol Krinsky, professor of art history at New York University and author of several books on architecture, gave a close reading of the entire penultimate draft of my manuscript. By taking seriously my plea to be treated as a student, Carol served as an additional editor, penciling numerous mar-<lb/>
ginal comments and queries that forced me to substantively rethink facts and points of view throughout. <name type="pname">Reuben Rainey</name>, professor of landscape architecture at the University of <name type="place">Virginia</name> School of Architecture, also read the manuscript in its entirety and gave me several key suggestions for its improvement. I am particularly grateful for the kindness and generosity of these two important first readers and hasten to make the usual author's disclaimer on their behalf: They are entirely innocent of any errors that may remain in my text.</p>
<p>The same is true for the several other scholars who have read individual chapters in the areas of their expertise. Chapter One benefited from the eyes and mind of the Egyptologist Patrick Cardon. For another reading of that chapter I am indebted to David Hurst Thomas, curator of North American Archaeology at the American Museum of Natural History, and to his associate and wife, <name type="pname">Lorann Pendleton</name>, director of the Nels Nelson North American Archaeology Laboratory, for their invaluable knowledge of, and advice on other resources for, understanding the Native American landscape. I am further grateful to my friend Dave Warren, who is a member of the <name type="pname">Santa Clara Pueblo</name>, for also reading Chapter One and expanding my per-<lb/>
ception of the sensory dimensions and cosmological underpinnings of prehistoric, early ancient, and con-<lb/>
temporary Native American place making and to <name type="pname">Khristaan Villela</name>, director of the Thaw Art History Center and assistant professor at the College of <name type="pname">Santa Fe</name>, for his thoughtful comments. <name type="pname">Rina Swentzell</name>, the Pueb-<lb/>
loan architectural historian, critiqued this chapter and made me understand more fully the sense she shares with many other Native Americans of the sacredness of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> nature, not merely certain important sites. Fur-<lb/>
ther, I wish to thank <name type="pname">Bradley T. Lepper</name>, curator of archaeology at the Ohio Historical Center in Columbus, for introducing me to the Mound Builders of southern Ohio. <name type="pname">Duane Anderson</name>, director of the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture of the Museum of <name type="place">New Mexico</name> in <name type="pname">Santa Fe</name>, gave my material on prehistoric and living Native American cultures a final, constructive reading, and Laura Hold, the librarian of the Laboratory of Anthropology at the Museum of <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, guided me to relevant materials on the archaeology of the Americas. Writer, artist, and preservationist Nikos Stavroulakis was a most helpful host as I studied Minoan sites on his native island, Crete.</p>
<p>I thank <name type="pname">Peter J. Holliday</name>, professor of history of art and classical archaeology, <name type="place">California</name> State Uni-<lb/>
versity, Long Beach, for the careful and constructive reading he gave of Chapter Two. I first saw the <name type="place">Athe-<lb/>
nian Acropolis</name> and <name type="place">Agora</name> in the company of classical scholar <name type="pname">Avi Sharon</name>, who provided many useful insights into the history and cultural meaning of these important spaces. Chapter Three benefited from the scrutiny of Steven Murray, professor of art history and noted medieval architectural historian at Columbia University, as well as from the assistance of two Islamists, <name type="pname">D. Fairchild Ruggles</name>, visiting assistant professor in the departments of architecture and landscape architecture, Cornell University, and <name type="pname">Behula Shah</name>, the director of landscape studies at Chatham College. All of these specialists were generous with their time and advice, and I was educated by their patient coaching.</p>
<p>Guy Walton, professor of fine arts, <name type="place">New York</name> University, and author and authority on French Renais-<lb/>
sance and seventeenth-century gardens, read Chapters Four and Five, and his suggestions regarding their improvement were invaluable. <name type="pname">Tracy Ehrlich</name>, assistant professor of Art History at Colgate University, has particular expertise in the area of the Italian villa garden, and her reading of these same two chapters was equally helpful. Magnus Olausson, National Museum, <name type="place">Sweden</name>, read the section on Drottningholm Palace gardens in Chapter Six and kindly met with me, enlarging my perspective on the relationship of Swedish

<name type="place">Europe</name>. I also thank <name type="pname">Lena L&#x00F6;fgren Upps&#x00E4;ll</name> and <name type="pname">Marie Edman Franzen</name> for sharing their knowledge of Swedish landscape design with me on our tour of Drottningholm Palace gardens.</p>
<p>Landscape architect Joseph Disponzio, a former colleague in the New York City Department of Parks and my teaching assistant in the course I taught in landscape design history at Columbia University in <date when="1991">1991</date>, is a now an assistant professor of landscape architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design. His knowl-<lb/>
edge of the French Picturesque style, the subject of his dissertation, and his critical reading of Chapter Seven were a great help. <name type="pname">Peter Fergusson</name>, professor of art history, Wellesley College, also gave me some eminently constructive suggestions on this chapter.</p>
<p>I wish to thank <name type="pname">Kendall H. Brown</name>, assistant professor in the Department of Art, <name type="place">California</name> State Uni-<lb/>
versity at Long Beach, and a former editor for the Macmillan <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Art,</hi> for reading Chapter Eight from the perspective of a East Asian specialist. <name type="pname">John Major</name>, East Asian scholar, author, anthologist, and coauthor of a guide to world literature also read Chapter Eight, and his knowledge of the Chinese and Jap-<lb/>
anese languages and cultures was for me an important asset. In addition, his suggestions regarding particu-<lb/>
lar poems and novels have illuminated my understanding of some relationships between literature and landscape design while also giving me many hours of pleasurable reading. <name type="pname">Kenji Wako</name>, associate professor in the depart-<lb/>
ment of Environmental Planning at Osaka University, provided some pertinent corrections to my manuscript as did <name type="pname">Yoshiko Nihei</name>, who also did the excellent picture research responsible for many of the illustrations in Chapter Eight. Finally, I thank Stephanie Wada, associate curator with the <name type="pname">Mary</name> and <name type="pname">Jackson Burke</name> Foundation and a specialist in the art of <name type="place">Japan</name>, for a final reading of this material.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Charles Beveridge</name>, series editor of the Frederick Law Olmsted Papers and a professor in the department of history, American University, <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, read Chapter Nine. This proved most helpful, as his intimate knowledge of the accomplishments of Olmsted and his partner Calvert Vaux surpasses my own long and appreciative familiarity with their work. <name type="pname">David Schuyler</name>, professor of American Studies at <name type="pname">Frank-<lb/>
lin</name> and Marshall College and also an editor of the Frederick Law Olmsted Papers, has special knowledge of the nineteenth-century American metropolitan landscape and is an authority on <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson Down-<lb/>
ing</name>, <name type="pname">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, and <name type="pname">Calvert Vaux</name>. His reading of Chapter Nine and subsequent chapters also provided me with fresh insights on subjects with which I was familiar but lacked his nuanced understanding.</p>
<p><name type="pname">David Streatfield</name>, professor of landscape architecture at the University of <name type="place">Washington</name> and an authority on the gardens of <name type="place">California</name>, gave me valuable insights into this region's role in the history of landscape design. I also offer thanks to George Brumder for hosting my tour of the gardens of Pasadena and arranging access to several private estates in Santa Barbara. Garden designer <name type="pname">Willem Wirtz</name> guided me around several private and public gardens in Palm Beach, <name type="place">Florida</name>, and I am grateful for his impressive store of knowledge of that community's landscape history, past and present.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Lance Neckar</name>, professor and associate dean of the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of <name type="place">Minnesota</name>, read Chapter Thirteen and provided constructive commentary on my treat-<lb/>
ment of modernist gardens in general. <name type="pname">Elizabeth G Miller</name> read part of this chapter as well, and Will Miller was a generous and thoughtful host on my tour of the <name type="pname">J. Irwin Miller</name> garden and related points of interest in Columbus, Indiana. George Waters, editor of <hi rend="italic">Pacific Horticulture</hi> magazine was a similarly instructive guide to the Donell Garden in <name type="place">Sonoma</name>, <name type="place">California</name>, and other nearby landscapes of the modern era. I am indebted to Gordon and Carole Hyatt for their many kindnesses to me when I was visiting Naumkeag in the Berk-<lb/>
shires. Because of the gracious assistance of <name type="pname">Ronaldo Maia</name>, I was accompanied by the knowledgeable Brazilian horticulturist Cynthia Zanotto Salvador on a tour of several of the modernist landscapes created by <name type="pname">Roberto Burle Marx</name>, which I also discuss in Chapter Thirteen. Chapter Fourteen benefited from an explanatory tour through the newly completed Animal Kingdom park in Walt Disney World in <name type="place">Orlando</name>, <name type="place">Florida</name>, with <name type="pname">Paul Comstock</name>, the head of landscape design within the Disney Company's Imagineering division.</p>
<p>When I was writing Chapter Fifteen, the artist <name type="pname">Nancy Holt</name> granted me an interview in which I learned a great deal about the process, both conceptual and technical, of producing art on a landscape scale. From her I also gained greater understanding of the role of her late husband, <name type="pname">Robert Smithson</name>, in the origins of
<pb n="19"/>
<pb n="19" type="orig"/>
the Earthworks movement. <name type="pname">Charles Jencks</name> was similarly kind in welcoming me to Portrack Garden in Dumfrieshire, <name type="place">Scotland</name>, and I thank Alistair Clark, the head gardener there, for his discussion of this land-<lb/>
scape work in progress. I am also grateful to Ian Hamilton Findlay for allowing me to spend a morning at Little <name type="place">Sparta</name>, his poetical landscape creation in Lanarkshire, <name type="place">Scotland</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Henry J. Stern</name>, commissioner of the <name type="place">New York</name> City Department of Parks and Recreation, has instilled in the agency over which he has presided during two mayoral administrations a strong sense of its history. <name type="pname">Jonathan Kuhn</name>, the agency's director of art and antiquities, provided helpful answers to several questions regarding the department's past as well as access to the material in its archives. I am grateful as well to Jane Weissmann, former director of Operation Green Thumb, and to Andrew Stone, director of the <name type="place">New York</name> City Land Project for the Trust for Public Land, who furnished me with materials and information relating to the community gardens movement discussed in Chapter Sixteen.</p>
<p>A book such as this one would be impossible without the patient research and insightful discoveries of these scholars, professional designers, and administrators as well as others listed in my bibliography. Their research, publications, and practice in the related fields of landscape design history and landscape restoration have made a fresh survey both necessary and possible. The lectures of my Yale professors, Vin-<lb/>
cent Scully and Christopher Tunnard, were, I am sure, partly responsible for my abiding enthusiasm for architecture, landscape, and urban design, an enthusiasm that was nourished by my friendship with the cultural geographer <name type="pname">J. B. Jackson</name>. Charles McLaughlin's loan of his thesis manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The Selected Let-<lb/>
ters of Frederick Law Olmsted</hi> when I was doing research for <hi rend="italic">Frederick Law Olmsted's <name type="place">New York</name></hi> in the days before photocopying machines, computers, or the subsequent publication of the multivolume Olmsted papers (an enterprise that he still supervises with fellow historian Charles Beveridge) stands out as an act of scholarly generosity and personal friendship for which I will always be grateful.</p>
<p>Other special friends include Sara Cedar Miller, the Central Park Conservancy historian and photog-<lb/>
rapher, who gave me invaluable help when this book was still in its infancy, and <name type="pname">Lane Addonizio</name>, my City-<lb/>
scape Institute colleague, who assisted in its final production. Without Sara's skills I could not have built the slide lectures from which the book germinated, and Lane's fine organizational ability kept both our office and this project on course. I am particularly grateful to the LuEster Mertz Trust and to Furthermore (the Publication Program of the <name type="pname">J. M. Kaplan</name> fund); the <name type="pname">Samuel H. Kress</name> Foundation; the <name type="pname">Henry Luce</name> Founda-<lb/>
tion; the <name type="pname">Eugene V.</name> and <name type="pname">Clare E. Thaw</name> Charitable Trust; the <name type="pname">Charles Evans Hughes</name> Memorial Foundation; and the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, for directly assisting the production of this book with foundation grants.</p>
<p>In Central Park I learned the value of collaboration and teamwork. That lesson has been reinforced by the people at <name type="pname">Harry N. Abrams</name>, Inc. Publisher and editor-in-chief Paul Gottlieb saw the need for a survey such as I proposed, and he allowed the book to grow beyond the specifications of our contract to its natural dimensions in terms of picture and word count. <name type="pname">John Crowley</name>, director of photographs and permissions, has been the most resourceful of picture editors, seeking out, with the help of <name type="pname">Diana Gongora</name>, images I was unable to provide and reading the manuscript carefully to assure the proper fit of pictures to text. Paulo Suzuki has brought his skills as an artist to our project and, basing his work upon earlier documents, has created a number of freshly drawn plans and perspectives to aid the reader's visualization of certain land-<lb/>
scapes discussed in the text. Elaine Banks Stainton, senior editor, has overseen the difficult process of readying the book for production. Ana Rogers is the book's designer, and her fine work speaks for itself. Our team leader has been <name type="pname">Julia Moore</name>, executive editor and director of textbook publishing, the most astute and considerate of editors. She has assured the integrity of our project at every turn, always advocating what is in the best interest of the book's intent and content rather than what is merely expedient or least costly.</p>
<p>I would like to add a final additional word of gratitude to Ted, my husband, for encouraging me to undertake this broad-scale survey in the first place and to persist in bringing it to publication. I thank him especially for sharing with me a wonderful educational adventure as we have walked together in the cities, parks, and gardens described in the following chapters and talked about the civilizations, including our own, that are responsible for the impressions we have gathered and the knowledge of place-making we have gained together.</p>
