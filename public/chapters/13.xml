<p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, an eclectic appli-<lb/>
cation of past styles of landscape design had substituted for one expressing in a forthright, forceful, and original manner the tenets of contemporary Machine Age culture. Le Corbusier railed famously against "the Styles," and when architectural modernism at last found widespread acceptance, it became doctrinal in its rad-<lb/>
ical break with tradition. No longer would architects camouflage the structural engineering systems of new buildings with the decor of previous eras as had been the case in modern nineteenth-cen-<lb/>
tury <name type="place">Paris</name>, where carved masonry was applied as a veneer over industrial materials. In the same way that modern artists sought to abandon old formalist values including single-point perspective as the generally accepted convention of spatial representation, archi-<lb/>
tects sought to express an entirely new aesthetic that was func-<lb/>
tionalist, democratic, and overtly expressive of machine technology. The avoidance of Neoclassical planning principles and handcrafted ornamentation became an article of faith for modern architects. Yet, while modern architecture overthrew eclecticism and devel-<lb/>
oped its own radically functionalist aesthetic, landscape architec-<lb/>
ture lagged behind.</p>
<p>A somewhat debased version of Arts and Crafts garden style was well suited to the agenda of an expanding nursery industry with a broad array of plant materials and garden ornaments for sale. Moreover, the machinelike precision found in modernist archi-<lb/>
tecture and a good deal of modern art was never wholly applicable to landscape design, because nature is biological and tectonic, not static. However hard-edged a ground plan may be, if it contains plants and soil and responds to the dynamics of natural ecosystems, its forms are inevitably subject to growth, decay, and the resulting organic transformation these processes involve. So argued those who sought to maintain a traditionalist approach to landscape design in the face of architectural modernism. In the United States, throughout the <date when="1930">1930</date>s the Harvard's Graduate School of Design, the leading professional school for training in landscape architec-<lb/>
ture, remained firmly committed to a Beaux-Arts-based curricu-<lb/>
lum with its emphasis upon an Italianate stylistic vocabulary, even as Walter Gropius was transforming the school's architecture department into an outpost of the European avant-garde.</p>
<p>But as provincialism and reactionary taste succumbed to the establishment of modern art and as modern architecture gained sta-<lb/>
tus and began to seem less revolutionary, American professionals began at last to participate in the spirit of landscape design innova-<lb/>
tion that the French had pioneered at the <date when="1925">1925</date> Exposition Interna-<lb/>
tionale des Arts D&#x00E9;coratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts). Unlike pre-<lb/>
vious World's Fairs, which had emphasized technological progress, this one was distinguished by the impulse on the part of the French to establish cultural leadership in the design arts. Within the Fair's articulation of a vocabulary of design forms&#x2014;now nostalgically recalled and revived as Art Moderne or Art Deco&#x2014;existed several early experiments that attempted to ally landscape with modernism. But modernism had many faces besides the one of streamlined luxe known as Art Deco, including the machine aesthetic of the Bauhaus and of Le Corbusier, whose architecture was represented as one of the fair's pavilions. A Mediterranean spirit often informed it. Chinese and Japanese influences were present, too.</p>
<p>By the late <date when="1930">1930</date>s, the carriers of modernism's several cultural crosscurrents included Mexican and South American landscape designers as well as European and American ones. Like architec-<lb/>
ture, landscape design became a regionally inflected international idiom. Although the United States still looked to Europe in cultural matters, the country's prosperity and the developments in indus-<lb/>
trial design as new consumer goods were produced following World War II created a climate that was congenial to innovation
<pb n="435"/>
<pb n="435" type="orig"/>
and the eventual assumption of a leadership role in the arts. This process was no doubt encouraged by the immigration to the United States from the <date when="1930">1930</date>s onward of several European artists of rare genius. In addition, now, more than ever, travel abroad was seen as a valuable extension of the professional education of Amer-<lb/>
ican designers along with the study of internationally circulated periodicals and books portraying the new. A stripped-down form of Beaux-Arts landscape design prevailed in a good deal of Amer-<lb/>
ican public park design as late as the <date when="1950">1950</date>s, as is evident from the parks built in <name type="place">New York</name> City and under the administration of <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name> (see Chapter Twelve). Nevertheless, traditional land-<lb/>
scape architecture based on Neoclassical planning principles had begun to seem anachronistic within the context of modernism's disavowal of historic styles and the premium it put on a certain shock value in the arts.</p>
<p>Moreover, within the context of a democratic society tradi-<lb/>
tionalism was associated with a conservative elite. Progressive land-<lb/>
scape architects needed to produce plans that were suitable for the construction budgets, lot sizes, and lives of middle-class home-<lb/>
owners. The emphasis modern people put on sports and physical recreation caused them to want houses and gardens that were more casual in appearance than those of former times, with open floor plans and informal ground plans that permitted the same uncon-<lb/>
stricted movement as did the relaxed clothing they now wore. This casual lifestyle, especially in <name type="place">California</name> where a freewheeling cul-<lb/>
tural ethos prevailed overall, encouraged a fresh approach to land-<lb/>
scape design. Here and in other warm-climate areas, outdoor entertaining and relaxation in and around a swimming pool were important elements in the landscape designer's program.</p>
<p>The spirit of radical innovation that characterized art and architecture of the modernist period gave license to the landscape designer to experiment with new forms and materials. New design concepts&#x2014;the use of overlapping planes rather than axial align-<lb/>
ment to provide spatial continuity, experimentation with both tra-<lb/>
ditional and nontraditional materials, use of abstract biomorphic forms as emblems and expressions of organic fluidity, and an inno-<lb/>
vative application of the machine aesthetic to garden structures furnished the modernist landscape with its own distinctive idiom as it addressed the age-old problem of exploiting visually the jux-<lb/>
taposition of the natural and the artificial.</p>
<p>Compensating for the elimination of applied ornament in Machine Age modern architecture was the new status given free-<lb/>
standing sculpture. The visual impact of the bronze nude by Georg Kolbe in the courtyard of the Barcelona Pavilion Mies van der Rohe built for that city's <date when="1929">1929</date> World's Fair is enhanced by the duty it per-<lb/>
forms, which is beyond all inherent aesthetic merit, as the only non-<lb/>
machine form within the structure, demonstrating the power of a single art object to arrest and satisfy the eye as it completes its move-<lb/>
ment through the building's serenely impersonal overlapping spa-<lb/>
tial planes. So, too, as landscape architecture became more avowedly functional and abstract, several designers found that the perfectly placed piece by Jacques Lipchitz or Henry Moore gave composi-<lb/>
tional focus to their plans. Sculpture had, of course, been at home in the garden since ancient times, as we have amply discovered in this book, but with the advent of modernism it took up residence in the landscape devoid of the didactic or memorial intent of for-<lb/>
mer times. In the modern garden sculpture was not intended as part of any allegorical program, nor was it meant to serve as com-<lb/>
memoration; it was displayed simply as aesthetic object. The instal-<lb/>
lation of outdoor sculpture according to the reputation of the artist rather than that of the subject depicted is a modernist contribution to landscape design. Corporations took a major role in this regard, and the same companies that commissioned prestigious modern architects to design their headquarters also installed major works of sculpture in adjacent plazas or surrounding industrial parks.</p>
<p>The challenges facing twentieth-century designers who sought to practice within the broader context of a rapidly trans-<lb/>
forming society with objectives that were more democratic in pur-<lb/>
pose than the provision of corporate prestige or idyllic retreats for the wealthy were considerable. As had been true in past ages, many of the patrons who commissioned modern gardens, corporate cam-<lb/>
puses, and high-style modern buildings with sculpture courts or plazas were indeed wealthy. Modernism's confidence in design as a primary means of addressing social problems now seems over-<lb/>
weening and, in light of the record, often wrongheaded. This has promoted the current return to neo-traditional principles in urban planning that we will examine in Chapter Fifteen. But the land-<lb/>
scape architects who came of age in the first half of the twentieth century shared the same optimism that we observed in the previ-<lb/>
ous chapter as we studied the regional planners who sought to rationally guide metropolitan growth or the starry-eyed futurists who displayed their upbeat technologically oriented scenarios for the World of Tomorrow at the <name type="place">New York</name> <date when="1939">1939</date> World's Fair. Espe-<lb/>
cially in <name type="place">America</name>, which was less scarred than Europe by the twen-<lb/>
tieth century's two World Wars, modernism held forth a sense of immense possibilities, and in an age that has become fetishistic about preserving and replicating the past, this optimism about the future may seem enviable to some.</p>

<p>The <date when="1925">1925</date> Exposition Internationale des Arts D&#x00E9;corat-<lb/>

lated the <name type="place">New York</name> World's Fair of <date when="1939">1939</date>. The <name type="place">New York</name> fair was a demonstration of burgeoning American industrial might and the consumerist future. The <date when="1925">1925</date> <name type="place">Paris</name> Exhibition was undertaken in large measure as a chauvinistic means of reasserting <name type="place">France</name>'s traditional hegemony as a stylistic trendsetter and unrivaled leader in the decorative arts.<ref target="#CH13-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref>Coming between the waning Arts and Crafts tradition and the rise of international modernism, the <name type="place">Paris</name> fair represented not only a pivotal point in design history but also a definitive moment in the final stages of the cultural transition from an ethos of privilege to one of equality, which had been under way since the eighteenth century. Unlike the <date when="1939">1939</date> <name type="place">New York</name> fair, which held out a clear vision of mass pros-<lb/>
perity, the one in <name type="place">Paris</name>, in spite of its declared intention to honor "art in life," nevertheless exuded an imagery of opulence and luxury, albeit in Machine Age terms and on a compact scale in keeping with the economic realities of the times.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier</name> (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1930">1930</date>), the land-<lb/>
scape architect who had had design responsibilities for several of the parks of <name type="place">Paris</name> since <date when="1887">1887</date>, was put in charge of all parks and gardens at the exhibition. Clearly evident was his own stylistic preference for Gallic for-<lb/>
mality softened by an Arts and Crafts horticultural palette and enlivened eclectically through the influence of Persia and southern Spain. Also evident was the influence of Cubism, Surrealism, and functionalism. The fair's purposeful endorsement of modernity was made somewhat superficial by the impulse to show-<lb/>
case design style, as implied by the word <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;coratif</hi> in the exposition's title. Several of the gardens of the fair were conceived as outdoor manifestations of Art Deco, the sleekly ornamental style found in the luxurious but spare furniture and architectural design of the period. A consensus that these modernistic gardens should be architectonic in character as well as architectural exten-<lb/>
sions of the house caused them to be more mineral than vegetal in character.</p>
<p>On a triangular site framed on two sides by glass walls, <name type="pname">Gabriel Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian</name> (<date when="1900">1900</date>&#x2013;<date when="1970">1970</date>) designed the Garden of Water and Light, the most avant-garde gar-<lb/>
den at the <date when="1925">1925</date> <name type="place">Paris</name> Exposition (fig. 13.1). Forestier commissioned it, expecting Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian to create a viewing garden, a <hi rend="italic">tableau-jardin</hi> "in the modern spirit with elements from Persian decor."<ref target="#CH13-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref>Its triangular shape announced the geometric motif contained in the small opaque pinkish panes of glass forming its screening walls, the zigzag pattern of flower beds arranged on an inclined plane, the subdivisions of its tiered pool, and some of the facets of an electrically illuminated, revolving, polyhedral sphere in its cen-<lb/>
ter. As a modernistic garden designer, Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian did not consider plants interesting in their own right but deployed them simply as bedded masses of bold shapes and striking colors.</p>

<p><name type="pname">Charles de Noailles</name>, an enthusiastic collector of modern art, was so impressed with Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian's cre-<lb/>
ation at the fair that he commissioned him to design a garden in Hy&#x00E8;res where the architect Robert Mallet-<lb/>
Stevens was building a villa for him and his wife Marie-Laure. Here, in <date when="1927">1927</date>, Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian created a gar-<lb/>
den in a space that appeared like the bow of a beached ship (fig. 13.2). Divorced from the surrounding land-<lb/>
scape by stark white converging walls forming an elongated isosceles triangle, the sharp geometries of
<pb n="437"/>
<pb n="437" type="orig"/>
rectangular flower beds, mosaic paving panels, and pool set within these uncompromising boundaries assert a mathematical, antinatural angularity. Though often called a Cubist garden, it is unavoidably three-<lb/>
dimensional because it is an architectural space and cannot therefore have the elusive, tensile interplay between picture surface and picture space of a Cubist painting.<ref target="#CH13-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>The Noailles garden did have, however, one element that linked it with the modern abstract art movement, a revolving sculpture by <name type="pname">Jacques Lipchitz</name> (<date when="1891">1891</date>&#x2013;<date when="1973">1973</date>) called <hi rend="italic">La Joie de vivre (The Joy of Life).</hi> Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian gave this pride of place at the apex of the isosceles triangle, the "prow" of the Noailles garden "ship." As modern garden design increasingly assumed a minimalist approach to horticulture, designers frequently placed large-scale works of sculp-<lb/>
ture like this Lipchitz piece in their landscape com-<lb/>
positions simply for aesthetic effect. This quite naturally gave rise in time to gardens where the designers' primary goal was to arrange an outdoor setting for the display of works of art. Notable later examples in the <name type="place">New York</name> metropolitan area include the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art in <name type="place">New York</name> City, Storm King Art Center in Moun-<lb/>
tainville, and the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in Long Island City.</p>
<p>At the time of the <date when="1925">1925</date> exposition, <name type="pname">Charles</name> and <name type="pname">Marie-Laure de Noailles</name> commissioned a second modernist essay in garden design on the 5,000-square-<lb/>
foot (1,524-square-meter) triangle of land adjacent to their nineteenth-century <hi rend="italic">h&#x00F4;tel</hi> in <name type="place">Paris</name> (fig. 13.3). Like their garden by Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian in Noailles, the Parisian garden by Andr&#x00E9; Vera (<date when="1881">1881</date>&#x2013;<date when="1971">1971</date>) and his brother <name type="pname">Paul Vera</name> (<date when="1882">1882</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>), a decorative artist, in collabo-<lb/>
ration with their friend <name type="pname">Jean-Charles Moreau</name> (<date when="1889">1889</date>&#x2013;<date when="1956">1956</date>) was primarily a viewing garden, its veg-<lb/>
etation being limited to low shrub masses and ground covers set within a ground plane of paving stones, pebbles, and gravel. A lattice-topped wall of light-<lb/>
catching mirrors reflected back upon the garden images of itself and the <hi rend="italic">h&#x00F4;tel.</hi></p>
<p>These and other avant-garde expressions of pos-<lb/>
sible new directions in landscape design pioneered in <name type="place">France</name> in the <date when="1920">1920</date>s were to influence the approach of a new generation of landscape architects in <name type="place">Amer-<lb/>

<p>Avid study of the gardens of the <date when="1925">1925</date> <name type="place">Paris</name> exposi-<lb/>

Harvard had just initiated the country's first graduate program in landscape architecture, and there Steele studied for a year with Fred-<lb/>
erick Law Olmsted, Jr., and Arthur Shurtleff, another member of the Olmsted firm. Their design approach was that of the prevailing Beaux-Arts system with its respect for axial planning and architectural integra-<lb/>
tion of building and site. The arduous curriculum combined these planning principles with studies in art history, architecture, surveying, hydrology, road and wall construction, geology, meteorology, phys-<lb/>
iography, botany, horticulture, plant identification, planting design, mathematics, languages, and con-<lb/>
tracts and specifications.</p>

</figure>
<p>Rather than return to Harvard the following year, Steele accepted the offer made by <name type="pname">Warren Henry Manning</name> (<date when="1860">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1938">1938</date>), a landscape architect trained by Olmsted Sr., to serve as his personal assistant and supervisor of planting for the firm. The son of a well-<lb/>
established nurseryman and the author of much of the planting plan for the Biltmore estate, Manning was an acknowledged plantsman. Having designed the park system for <name type="place">Harrisburg</name>, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, he was also a city planner, as well as busy professional with many important private commissions. Steele's apprenticeship with Manning lasted six years. It gave the aspiring young landscape architect a practical edu-<lb/>
cation that he valued above Harvard's academic one. His experience in Manning's <name type="place">Boston</name> firm, combined with his intelligence, gift with words, and social skills, enabled Steele to begin an independent practice after returning from an extended study tour of European gardens in <date when="1913">1913</date>. In this new phase of his career he absorbed the ideas of his friend, the Gothic Revival
<pb n="438"/>
<pb n="438" type="orig"/>
architect <name type="pname">Ralph Adams Cram</name> (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x2013;<date when="1942">1942</date>), as well as ideas gleaned from frequent travels abroad. After serv-<lb/>
ice as a photographer in World War I, he resumed his practice and gained a reputation as an outspoken shaper of opinion, engaging lecturer, and frequent contributor to professional and popular periodicals such as <hi rend="italic">Landscape Architecture, House Beautiful,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gar-<lb/>
den Club of <name type="place">America</name> Bulletin.</hi></p>
<p>The <date when="1920">1920</date>s were mostly prosperous years up until the Great Depression, and Steele's practice flourished as wealthy clients called upon his services. But his inter-<lb/>
ests in landscape design went beyond estate design. In Steele's view, the middle-class suburban garden should be a place of privacy with hedges or tall shrubbery screening it from passersby, a place for family life, friendship, and daydreaming. Modern psychology, with its emphasis upon the facets of individual per-<lb/>
sonality and the importance of dreams, was a signifi-<lb/>
cant ingredient in his approach to garden design. Increasingly, Steele intended his gardens to serve as quasi-magical private realms where landscape art encouraged relaxation into a state of reverie and fan-<lb/>
tasy, spaces in which their owners would find freedom from the conventions that governed their daily lives.</p>
<p>In <date when="1924">1924</date>, he published <hi rend="italic">Design in the Little Garden.</hi> Here he argued for functional domestic arrange-<lb/>
ments, advising home builders to eliminate useless front lawns, place kitchen, garage, and laundry yard on the street side for convenience, and screen them from public view with shrubbery. If this were done, "our living-rooms should open on the old despised back-yards now turned into gardens and terraces, no matter how small. . . . With such a scheme we may be content that not a foot of room has been wasted; that everything is where use and common sense would have it; and that finally we have cleared the old back-yard to make ready for a proper setting for our out-of-door life."<ref target="#CH13-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In his writing Steele was bold enough to criti-<lb/>
cize the Olympian serenity of Le N&#x00F4;tre, suggesting that in landscape design rationality should be tem-<lb/>
pered with sensuality and a degree of poetic mystery. But French culture exerted a powerful hold upon his imagination, and he kept abreast of the published works of Forestier and Andr&#x00E9; Vera and returned from the <name type="place">Paris</name> exposition of <date when="1925">1925</date> filled with both positive and negative opinions on all that he had seen. He was excited by modernism's design potential for the cre-<lb/>
ative landscape architect, and on subsequent trips to <name type="place">France</name> he continued to study such gardens as the one Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian created for the Noailles in Hy&#x00E8;res. His article, "New Pioneering in Garden Design," pub-<lb/>
lished in <hi rend="italic">Landscape Architecture</hi> in <date when="1930">1930</date>, praises Tony Garnier for giving the garden "a marked vibration" by modifying symmetrical axial planning in a way that "the axis is broken again and again, although rarely entirely lost."<ref target="#CH13-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Steele's enthusiasm for abstract, nonassocia-<lb/>
tional design concepts was transmitted to a new gen-<lb/>
eration of young landscape architects, among them Garrett Eckbo, James Rose, and Daniel Urban Kiley (like Steele, an apprentice in Warren Manning's firm). This group of American modernist landscape design-<lb/>
ers also learned from Steele how to take into account their clients' twentieth-century lifestyle, with its more casual domesticity, fewer servants, and increased appreciation for the outdoors. They perceived rightly that Steele was both a link with the Beaux-Arts tradi-<lb/>
tion and, because of his openness to experiment and innovation, the profession's foremost modernist influ-<lb/>
ence in <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
<p>Steele's masterpiece, Naumkeag, the estate of Mabel Choate in <name type="place">Stockbridge</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, begun in <date when="1926">1926</date>, bears witness to the synthesis of his Beaux-<lb/>
Arts training and deep appreciation of historic exam-<lb/>
ples with his delight in modernism's abstract shaping of space and exploration of bold new materials, forms, and color. To this synthesis he added his own desire to design individualized garden spaces that were highly experiential outdoor rooms. Steele found the garden already there to be satisfactory in many respects. It had been designed by Nathan Barrett of <name type="place">Boston</name>, the author of two early land-planning devel-<lb/>
opments&#x2014;the industrial community of Pullman, <name type="place">Illi-<lb/>
nois</name>, and the residential suburb of Tuxedo Park, <name type="place">New York</name>&#x2014;after Joseph Choate had chosen to ignore Frederick Law Olmsted's advice to situate the house half-way down the hillside near a particularly fine oak tree, preferring instead the top of Prospect Hill.</p>

</figure>
<p>Here Steele set about doing the thing he liked best, shaping landscape space, analyzing existing and desirable conditions in order to determine the out-<lb/>
lines of Mabel Choate's proposed new terrace, or Afternoon Garden: its relationship to the house (a location was chosen next to the library), a wall to screen the entrance drive, the inclusion of a large elm
<pb n="439"/>
<pb n="439" type="orig"/>
tree within its embrace, a means of framing the view (fig. 13.4). Ingeniously, he decided to have an Italian sculptor carve old oak pilings from <name type="place">Boston</name> harbor in a bold "Norwegian" manner. The masts were never-<lb/>
theless meant to evoke the posts used for tying up gondolas in the canals of <name type="place">Venice</name>, and their flaring finial-crowned, multicolored tops were painted to resemble "medieval trappings." These imaginative uprights framed the splendid view of the rolling Berk-<lb/>
shires, and nothing more was needed to give the ter-<lb/>
race a sense of spatial enclosure than a swag of rope festooned with clematis and <name type="place">Virginia</name> creeper running between the vertical posts. A sculpture, <hi rend="italic">Boy with Heron,</hi> by <name type="pname">Frederick MacMonnies</name> (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x2013;<date when="1937">1937</date>), was taken from inside the house and placed, not on the terrace as one might expect, but at the perimeter, where it could act as a foreground foil to the land-<lb/>
scape beyond.</p>
<p>Steele then enlivened the ground plane with "four little fountains, memories of the Generalife" gardens in Granada (see fig. 3.9). Their scalloped edges set in motion a series of curves that, like "an old French knot," consisted of an edging of minia-<lb/>
ture box within which blue lobelia mulched with coal, yellow santolina, and pink crushed marble provided color, while a small black-glass-lined pool reflected the sky. Irregular brown flagstones surrounded the "giddy carpet" Steele had thus flung down, and on this paving with its green cushions of arenaria squeezing through the crevices and on the rustic masonry retaining walls of the terrace he now placed pots filled with fuchsias, calla lilies, agapanthus, and bamboo like those he had seen in the quiet patios of Seville or C&#x00F3;rdoba. Beds of ferns and lilies in the corners, a quietly dripping wall fountain, and "thrones" with matching footstools of pink concrete completed the evocative picture.<ref target="#CH13-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Steele's growing originality as a designer was manifested in a second campaign to improve the land-<lb/>

ing space, but also as one of making foreground and background enter into a design dialogue similar to that found in the Japanese garden when borrowed scenery is a compositional element. Together client and landscape architect discussed the problem of the South Lawn and its relationship to the spectacular view. The collaborators' stroke of genius was the cre-<lb/>
ation of what Robin Karson, Steele's biographer, calls "the first modern earthwork in this country," a bold curve sculpted of landfill Miss Choate appropriated from a nearby excavation for a new house foundation. The line of its sloping ridge and the sweeping arc it traced on the ground provided a harmonious fore-<lb/>
ground echo of the view toward Bear Mountain that had been revealed by tree pruning. As Steele later commented, "The only resource was to create an abstract form in the manner of modern sculpture, with swinging curves and slopes which would aim to make their impression directly, without calling on the help of associated ideas, whether in nature or art."<ref target="#CH13-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref> A line of locust trees with globular heads emphasize this form in the landscape (fig. 13.5). Steele and Choate then fashioned an original bit of <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi> out of recy-<lb/>
cled ornamental cast iron, which they placed at the terminus of the South Lawn, later setting within it a Chinese-scholar garden rock on a Ming pedestal.</p>

<pb n="440"/>

prompted by the presence of native birches elsewhere on the property, Steele planted a dense grove of these trees in the intervening spaces between the four sets of stairs. The tonal correspondence of the white trunks and the white railings, together with the jux-<lb/>

<p>Included in the small and vanishing circle of monied Americans who could indulge a passion for landscape design on their private estates than could <name type="pname">Mabel Choate</name> were <name type="pname">Walter Beck</name> (<date when="1864">1864</date>&#x2013;<date when="1954">1954</date>) and his wife, <name type="pname">Marion Burt Stone Beck</name> (<date when="1876">1876</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959">1959</date>). On the 950-acre property she owned in Millbrook, <name type="place">New York</name>, when they married in <date when="1922">1922</date>, the couple set out to create an English-style landscape surrounding their newly com-<lb/>
pleted Queen Anne-style house, which was modeled on Wisley, the experimental plant headquarters of the Royal Horticultural Society in <name type="place">England</name>.<ref target="#CH13-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref>Beck was an artist with a deep appreciation of Chinese land-<lb/>
scape painting. Around <date when="1930">1930</date>, after having studied descriptions and images of the famous garden of Wang Wei, the Tang dynasty official who was a poet, painter, and garden builder (see Chapter Eight), he became convinced that Chinese design principles, rather than English ones, should govern Innisfree, as the couple called their garden after the poem of that title by William Butler Yeats.</p>
<p>Paintings after Wang Wei's original painting of his Wangchuan Villa garden consist of twenty scenes, compositional groupings of pines and other trees with various small structures set beside a broad river, which is cradled by softly rounded mountains. The bowl-like character of this landscape of rising forms rimming the river basin, as well as the gently cupped aspects of the individual scenes within it, appealed to Beck, who began to create around the lake in Millbrook a series of highly poetic "cup gardens" using weathered stones in carefully balanced compositions. With a work crew of twenty, Beck mined promising parts of the estate where boulders with the fine sculptural qualities prized by Chinese garden-builders lay partially buried in the knobby glacial till. He then ordered these excavated treasures to be transported to the sites where he wished to compose his cup gardens. One of these gar-<lb/>
dens might take the form of a rock- and vegetation-<lb/>
rimmed hollow. Another might appear as an overturned teacup, thereby resembling one of the softly rounded, mist-wreathed mountains in a paint-<lb/>
ing of Wang Wei's garden. Beck took exquisite care in placing his rocks, using well-concealed cement to anchor them after achieving an intuitively "just right," often precarious, balance. He also took pains to find the appropriate compositional "dialogue" between
<pb n="441"/>
<pb n="441" type="orig"/>
landscape and rocks and among the various individ-<lb/>
ual rocks (fig. 13.8). Having invested the carefully selected stones with pictorial character, he then gave them names&#x2014;Tiptoe Rock, Dragon Rock, Owl Rock, and Turtle Rock.</p>
<p>A comprehensive treatment of the entire land-<lb/>
scape surrounding the lake on the Becks' Millbrook property had to await the integrative vision supplied by Lester Collins (<date when="1914">1914</date>&#x2013;<date when="1993">1993</date>), a Harvard-trained land-<lb/>
scape architect who had spent two years in China fol-<lb/>
lowed by a year in Kyoto. The Becks met Collins during his student days; he became instrumental in the garden's creation, and at Marion Beck's invitation after her husband's death in <date when="1954">1954</date>, its principal creative force and the author of the plan transforming it from a private Elysium into a garden for public visitation. Collins took over Innisffee's design in <date when="1960">1960</date> where Beck had left off, arranging the several cup gardens into an integrated composition threaded with paths to link them. He made the overall landscape kineti-<lb/>
cally experiential. A knowledgeable horticulturist, as was Marion Beck who also contributed ideas, Collins enhanced some of Beck's cup gardens with vegeta-<lb/>
tion and created special effects of his own. He also constructed several earthen berms, recontouring the land in order to frame views, direct movement, or develop a topographical profile that would either terminate a vista or else stimulate interest in what lay beyond. He designed the garden's wood bridges and the eighty wooden chairs in which visitors can now repose. Collins compared the Innisfree garden with its many individual scenes connected by paths and bridges with the Yuan Ming Yuan, the famous garden begun by the Yongzheng emperor and completed by the Qianlong emperor in the eighteenth-century Qing dynasty (see Chapter Eight).</p>
<p>In scale, the Millbrook garden is analogous to this imperial garden, and its studied tranquility evokes the mood of the broad river-valley scenery depicted in paintings of Wang Wei's garden; these, not the miniaturized landscapes of the Suzhou scholar-gar-<lb/>
dens, were the exemplars for Beck and Collins at Innisfree. But while the designers may have had the Yuan Ming Yuan most clearly in mind, Innisfree can also be compared with two other cupped lake-gardens exam-<lb/>
ined in Chapters Seven and Eight: Henry Hoare's Stourhead and Shugakuin Rikyu, the lifework of the retired Japanese emperor Go-Mizunoo. Like these, Innisfree is a highly personal aesthetic statement, an exercise in garden poetics. Beck and Collins merely applied Chinese landscape design principles and rock vocabulary toward this end; they had no intention of replicating a Chinese garden in any more exact sense. Beck's inventiveness and training as an artist are evi-<lb/>
dent not only in his Chinese-inspired rock arrange-<lb/>
ments but also in his retaining walls and stair steps. His technical ability as both an artist and a craftsman is especially apparent in the patterned brick-and-slate terrace he designed, with a dragon panel incised by him (fig. 13.9).</p>
<p>Collins's year in <name type="place">Japan</name> resulted in his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Sensai Hisho</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Secret Garden Book.</hi> Its principles, particularly those concerning the construction of waterfalls, proved instructive as he and Beck worked together to achieve some of Innisffee's most beauti-<lb/>
ful effects.<ref target="#CH13-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>Few drawings of the gardens at Innisfree exist, although Collins was a practicing landscape architect and an academic dean. All was created on the site, using Beck's own work crew. Garden hoses outlined a future shoreline or path, and stakes or a human figure stood in the landscape to help deter-<lb/>
mine the position of a boulder. Patient experiment was needed to engineer a waterfall in such a way that it produced a cloud of mist, the merest trickle over a rock lip, a fluid sheet glossing a surface of schist or granite, a pluming jet, or a silvery runnel (fig. 13.10). Engineering expertise conducted this water into the ground where a carefully constructed drainage sys-<lb/>
tem carries it to the water table or the lake.</p>

<pb n="442"/>

isfree conceals its technological apparatus beneath an Arts and Crafts aesthetic informed by Chinese art and organizes space in the manner of a traditional stroll garden. Collins's ability to effect a synthesis between art and nature through design and technology helped transform Innisfree from a private dreamworld into a publicly acces-<lb/>
sible one. He gave due consideration to visitor interest, comfort, and safety; at the same time he cut staff in order to work within the budget of the Innisfree Foun-<lb/>

<p>Personal Elysiums like Naumkeag and Innisfree, throwbacks to an earlier tradition of great estate land-<lb/>
scapes, illustrate the growing influence of East Asian ideals on Western gar-<lb/>
dens. Like the Edwardian gardens we have studied, their fundamental purpose was to serve as idyllic retreats from the Machine Age. In <name type="place">England</name>, in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s, the long-lingering aesthetic of the Picturesque, the mellowing hand of the Arts and Crafts Movement, the energies of plant hybridizers, and a vigorous nursery trade still actively informed public taste, perpetuating this conservative landscape tradition. At the same time, however, a committed modernist dared to voice the grounds for radical change and to examine how the planning principles of the Japanese garden might stimulate a new approach to landscape design.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Christopher Tunnard's Influential Book</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Christopher Tunnard</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1979">1979</date>) was a Canadian-<lb/>
born landscape architect who worked in <name type="place">England</name> and then took up permanent residence in the United States where he became a professor of city planning first at Harvard and then at Yale.<ref target="#CH13-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>No one who knew him in <name type="place">America</name>, where he was a strong advocate of historic preservation, would have guessed that he had been an early firebrand in the cause of landscape modernism while still a young man living in <name type="place">England</name>. But Tunnard, like Fletcher Steele, had taken note of Gu&#x00E9;vr&#x00E9;kian's bold departure from tradition, and other new landscape design developments in <name type="place">France</name> and elsewhere in Europe. A member of the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS), the British affiliate of the Congr&#x00E8;s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), Tunnard was impressed with the polemical rhetoric and the work of <name type="pname">Adolf Loos</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1933">1933</date>) and Le Corbusier.</p>
<p>Tunnard was also familiar with landscape design history and English gardening tradition. Without con-<lb/>
sidering the relationship between older landscape idioms and cultural values, in <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the Modern Landscape</hi> (<date when="1938">1938</date>), a loosely woven collection of revised essays on the subject, he adopted the radical stance then current among modern architects of debunking past styles. Having set up this foil of discredited his-<lb/>
tory, Tunnard was ready to study how "as an element inseparable from the problems of housing, and urban and rural development, garden planning can, with the least opposition, achieve its modern form." Quoting Loos ("To find beauty in form instead of making it depend on ornament is the goal to which humanity is aspiring") and Le Corbusier ("The styles are a lie"), he set forth his own doctrine: "The functional garden," he wrote, "avoids the extremes both of the sen-<lb/>
timental expressionism of the wild garden and the intellectual classicism of the ‘formal' garden; it embodies rather a spirit of rationalism and through an aesthetic and practical ordering of its units pro-<lb/>
vides a friendly and hospitable milieu for rest and recreation. It is, in effect, the social conception of the garden."<ref target="#CH13-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>He declared that "China's symbolical landscape gardens with their islands of eternal youth and hap-<lb/>
piness&#x2014;scenes which provoked a century of Nature-<lb/>
copyism in the West&#x2014;hold little for us." But in Japanese gardens he found a congenial minimalism,
<pb n="443"/>
<pb n="443" type="orig"/>
integration of indoor and outdoor space, and the compositional principle he called "occult balance," whereby counterpoise was achieved through an asymmetrical arrangement of parts in equilibrium along a diagonal axis. The Japanese editorial hand that pruned away unnecessary vegetation and carefully arranged those plants that remained for subtle but maximum effect was in keeping with modernism's movement away from a "barbaric massing of color" toward "an acceptance of form, line and economy of material as being of first importance."<ref target="#CH13-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Tunnard allied himself with such modern archi-<lb/>
tects as Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. The former's country villas, raised from the ground by pilotis, were dissociated from nature but nevertheless presided over broad views that were an important aspect of their architectural planning and expressed a pastoral tradition harking back to Virgil.<ref target="#CH13-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref>The houses of the latter, on the other hand, sometimes grasped raw nature in an intimate embrace, as is par-<lb/>
ticularly evident in Fallingwater of <date when="1937">1937</date>, Wright's most famous work, poised above Bear Run, in west-<lb/>
ern Pennsylvania. Both of these modernists created architecture that corresponded with what Tunnard called the "empathic" approach to landscape planning whereby "nature is not to be regarded as a refuge from life, but as an invigorator of it and a stimulus to body and mind."<ref target="#CH13-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref>If one of the unstated motives of such Picturesque theorists as Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight had been to make untamed nature more agreeable by considering it as art, that was now no longer an issue. By the mid-twentieth century, much of nature had been tamed, and it needed no apologists; it was simply there in the form of sunlight, fresh air, and good views to be actively, <hi rend="italic">functionally</hi> enjoyed. Included in the empathic, func-<lb/>
tionalist layout were outdoor dining areas, decks, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other accou-<lb/>
trements of modern life with its orientation to leisure and recreation. Tunnard's later follower, Garrett Eckbo, called this a "landscape for living." (These aspects of design did not engage the imaginations of either Le Corbusier or Wright, who were more romantic than functionalist in their approach to nature.)</p>
<p>Further, Tunnard urged the collaboration of modern artists in the landscape design process; archi-<lb/>
tects were already working with sculptors and painters. Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion of <date when="1929">1929</date> was a notable recent example of the symbiosis of Machine Age architectural form and materials and a single per-<lb/>
fectly placed work of sculpture. The Noailles garden in Hy&#x00E8;res showed how effective the sculpture by Lip-<lb/>
chitz was as an element in the landscape.</p>
<p>Tunnard's own career as a landscape architect was brief, and he later retreated from radical mod-<lb/>
ernist advocacy. But the work he presented in <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the Modern Landscape,</hi> enhanced by the drawings of Gordon Cullen, illustrates how in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s at Bent-<lb/>
ley Wood in Halland, East Sussex, the home of the architect Serge Chermayeff (<date when="1900">1900</date>&#x2013;<date when="1996">1996</date>), and in his own house at St. Ann's Hill, Chertsey (fig. 13.11), Tun-<lb/>
nard practiced the landscape modernism he preached.</p>
<p>The Chermayeff house of steel-framed, weath-<lb/>
erboarded construction, with expansive south walls of glass opening toward a distant rural view, had a ter-<lb/>
race sheltered by a plate-glass screen away from the house. For a year before the house was built, he care-<lb/>
fully removed trees in a second-growth woodland to open a view toward the distant horizon. He attempted no planting except for a mass of natural-<lb/>
ized daffodils, a few carefully grouped trees and shrubs near the house, and some narrow flower beds along the terrace edge and its sheltering wall. Near the far open corner of this protected sundeck, there was a sculpture of a reclining female by Henry Moore (<date when="1898">1898</date>&#x2013;<date when="1986">1986</date>), carefully positioned according to Tun-<lb/>
nard's principle of occult balance.</p>
<p>In prescribing a modern landscape style, Tun-<lb/>
nard expressed his own fundamental love of plants and scenery. Stripped of sentimental association, these were to be enjoyed, like abstract art, in terms of color, form, texture, and compositional balance. Whereas functionalist architects and planners usually paid little attention to horticulture, Tunnard urged that "[we] not let the humanism of the gardener's philosophy depart from us." At the same time, he saw the mod-<lb/>
ern landscape as a space to be enjoyed collectively, not "the hedged, personal, half-acre of today, but a unit of the broad green landscape itself, controlled for the benefit of all."<ref target="#CH13-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>The last chapter of Tunnard's <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the
<pb n="444"/>
<pb n="444" type="orig"/>
Modern Landscape</hi> is devoted to "the wider planning [of] civic landscape architecture."<ref target="#CH13-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref>Here he called for a new regional idiom linking society and nature, city planning and landscape architecture, the garden and the large-scale recreational park. Tunnard wished to promote egalitarian land planning synthesizing the talents of the engineer&#x2014;"whose activities are per-<lb/>
haps the greatest contribution made to the landscape in the last one hundred years"<ref target="#CH13-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;the landscape archi-<lb/>
tect, and the architect. His planning philosophy cele-<lb/>
brating the builders of roadways and bridges as well as the makers of gardens and the designers of recre-<lb/>
ational facilities was similar in spirit to that of <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>. At this hopeful moment in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s it was possible to dream of a future of well-organized urban growth in which decision-making power was vested in planners capable of rationally premising their work on functionality and human needs as they wedded technology and nature into a grand design.</p>
<p>It is remarkable just how principled was the spirit of early modernism with its frank avowal of machine-made materials and its honest and optimistic search for an aesthetic that served and expressed a new social order. Although later shorn of its youth-<lb/>
ful idealism, the exploration of the problem raised by modernism with regard to landscape design contin-<lb/>
ued in the belief that scientifically rational planning combined with an aesthetic of pure form and new spatial concepts could serve as expressive ends in themselves, replacing older cultural values emanat-<lb/>
ing from cosmology, religion, philosophy, horticul-<lb/>
ture, and history. And, much as the Becks had suspected when they saw the work of Le Corbusier and his followers as being more appropriately situ-<lb/>
ated in <name type="place">South America</name> than in Millbrook, <name type="place">New York</name>, it was in Brazil, where a significant spark&#x2014;the Sao Paulo Modern Art Week of <date when="1922">1922</date>&#x2014;had ignited a remarkable cultural and aesthetic revolution, that the modernist landscape in collaboration with modern architecture found one of its most creative exponents.</p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Roberto Burle Marx and the Garden as Abstract Art</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Roberto Burle Marx</name> (<date when="1909">1909</date>&#x2013;<date when="1994">1994</date>) was a protean artist&#x2014;painter, sculptor, muralist, and craftsman&#x2014; with an affinity for nature and the baroque mor-<lb/>
phology of the tropical vegetation of his native Brazil. Given the opportunity to collaborate with architects who were modernist innovators, he found his most expressive m&#x00E9;tier as a landscape designer. His approach to landscape paralleled his approach to painting; he employed a graphic style that treated the ground plane in the same abstract manner as Le N&#x00F4;tre or Capability Brown had but with a modernist sensibility sympathetic to the undulating lines and biomorphic shapes found in the art of Jean Arp, Joan Mir&#x00F3;, and Alexander Calder. The strong curvilinear forms of the Brazilian coastal landscape around Rio de Janeiro coincidentally echoed the biomorphic forms found in their work, and this native scenery had an obvious effect on Burle Marx as a designer. With a scientist's curiosity and an unrivaled botanical col-<lb/>
lection from his own expeditions in the Brazilian hin-<lb/>
terlands, he confidently deployed luxuriant, vividly colored tropical plants, some with highly architec-<lb/>
tonic forms, in visually strong compositions that evoked and often directly echoed the local landscape, drawing it into the garden in the manner of Japanese "borrowed" scenery. This style effectively comple-<lb/>
mented and enriched the austere lines of functional-<lb/>
ist buildings.</p>
<p>In <date when="1934">1934</date>, at the inviation of Lima Cavalcanti, the governor of the state of Pernambuco, Burle Marx accepted a job in Recife redesigning and restoring the public gardens of that faded provincial capital. Dur-<lb/>
ing his two-year sojourn in Recife, Burle Marx became an active member of the city's intellectual commu-<lb/>
nity, making friends and establishing lasting relation-<lb/>
ships among a group of young poets, painters, writers, and musicians. He developed his graphic approach to garden design as he prepared India ink perspectives of several public squares and parks, including the Euclides da Cunha Square (<date when="1935">1935</date>), which he envisioned as a cactus garden (fig. 13.12). For this project he went into the dry northeastern region of Brazil called the <hi rend="italic">caatinga</hi> to collect various kinds of succulents, which he then arranged and installed.</p>

</figure>
<p>Burle Marx's participation in a coterie with left-<lb/>
ist views caused him to fall into disfavor with the mayor, prompting his resignation and return to Rio in <date when="1937">1937</date>. There he set up an atelier and resumed con-<lb/>
tact with his friends from the School of Fine Arts. The architect L&#x00FA;cio Costa (b. <date when="1902">1902</date>) had invited Le Cor-<lb/>
busier to come to Rio to advise on the design of a new building for the Ministry of Education and Public Health, a controversial early modernist structure where Burle Marx assisted the well-known artist C&#x00E2;n-<lb/>
ido Portinari (<date when="1903">1903</date>&#x2013;<date when="1962">1962</date>) in painting a large mural
<pb n="445"/>
<pb n="445" type="orig"/>
representing the economic cycles of Brazil. Probably at Costa's suggestion, Burle Marx was asked to also participate on the architectural design team, which included, in addition to Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and several other young Brazilian modernists. Burle Marx was put in charge of designing the ground-level plaza, the minister's office terrace garden, and a roof gar-<lb/>
den. This last occupied the top of the low-rise section of the building and therefore functioned as an old-<lb/>
fashioned <hi rend="italic">parterre,</hi> being designed for viewing from above, in this case from the windows of the raised slab housing the offices of the ministry.</p>
<p>The gardens for the Ministry of Education and Public Health demonstrated Burle Marx's method of treating the garden plane in a manner analogous to a painter's canvas. Upon the roof garden, for instance, he "drew" curvilinear abstract forms reminiscent of aerial views of Brazilian rivers. Texture and color played important roles. There were spiky bird-of-<lb/>
paradise plants and other plants&#x2014;agaves, dracaenas, and palms&#x2014;laid out as sculptural accents or single masses of color. His approach to landscape design as aestheticized nature was essentially the same as his approach to painting. "My message is purely picto-<lb/>
rial," he once declared, "it revolves around color, rhythm, and form, trying to abstain from the anec-<lb/>
dotal, believing that pictorial language begins when the word loses the reason for being."<ref target="#CH13-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Burle Marx's vision of the modernist garden as pure visual experience unencumbered by textual meaning can be appreciated in both the gouache plan and the realized landscape of the Odette Monteiro Garden (now the Luiz Cezar Fernandes Garden) in Correas in the state of <name type="pname">Rio de Janeiro</name> (<date when="1948">1948</date>) (figs. 13.13, 13.14, 13.15). Although he often worked in close collaboration with modern architects, he was unlike the garden formalists who followed Reginald Blom-<lb/>
field's prescription for integrating house and garden in a unified, axially coordinated scheme, or such land-<lb/>
scape modernists as Tunnard, who wished to do the same thing in an asymmetrical manner. Instead, he saw garden design as a generally independent, nonar-<lb/>
chitectural, <hi rend="italic">contrapuntal,</hi> and primarily artistic endeavor. On the Monteiro estate, he virtually ignored the house by Wladimir Alves Souza. His aim here was to reiterate in certain ground plane forms the profile of the surrounding mountainscape.</p>

<p>By the time Burle Marx designed the Odette Monteiro Garden, the landscape design and con-<lb/>
struction business he was running with his brother Siegfried had grown. In addition, he wanted space for his expanding botanical collection and the nursery where the brothers propagated and grew plants for the firm's projects. In <date when="1949">1949</date>, they were able to purchase a former coffee plantation, S&#x00ED;tio Santo Antonio da Bica (Saint Anthony of the Spring), in Campo Grande, nineteenmiles south of Rio. On this hilly site offering a series of microclimates, he installed his collection of tropical plants, which was becoming one of out-<lb/>
standing scientific merit, thanks to his friendship and collaboration with Henrique Llahmeyer de Mello Barreto, a botanist and the head of Rio's zoological garden, with whom he undertook several phytogeo-<lb/>
graphical excursions into the Brazilian interior. At the

S&#x00ED;tio&#x2014;now his weekend home, painting studio, and horticultural laboratory&#x2014;he grew bromeliads, calatheas, philodendrons, anthuriums, and heliconia in shade houses. On higher ground, above the remod-<lb/>

<p>Although a knowledgeable plantsman and com-<lb/>
mitted environmentalist concerned about the pro-<lb/>
tection of the rain forest, art was for Burle Marx a more fundamental interest than science, for it was as an artist that he sought to use individually interesting plant species as a means of establishing accents, fill-<lb/>
ing the biomorphic outlines of his planting beds, and shaping space. It was as an artist, too, that he salvaged bits of old architectural fabric from buildings that were being torn down as Rio's modernization rushed forward, and these he recomposed within the gardens of the S&#x00ED;tio (fig. 13.16). Here, where the slightly men-<lb/>
acing air of tropical fecundity is interwoven with these enigmatic and melancholy-seeming fragments, one senses Burle Marx's affinity for Surrealism.<ref target="#CH13-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The same spirit of improvisational protean cre-<lb/>
ativity that characterized life at the S&#x00ED;tio also pervaded Burle Marx's office in Rio where he presided like a Renaissance <hi rend="italic">capo di bottega</hi> over an artisans' workshop. From here flowed floral decorations for receptions, sculptures, murals, jewelry, textile designs, and stage sets as well as more than 2,000 plans for various land-<lb/>
scapes and cityscapes. Although he achieved some of his finest results as a collaborator with modern archi-<lb/>
tects such as Rino Levi with whom he designed the estate of the industrialist Olivo Gomes, in Sao Jos&#x00E9; dos Campos, Sao Paulo, he remained as interested as he had been as a young park designer in Recife in applying his modernist landscape approach to public spaces. In <date when="1954">1954</date>, he received a commission for the 289-<lb/>
acre Flamengo Park on landfill adjacent to Guanabara Bay near the heart of Rio. Like the recreational facil-<lb/>
ities that were built in conjunction with the water-<lb/>
front parkways of <name type="pname">Robert Moses</name>, Flamengo Park was undertaken as part of a coastal highway project designed to relieve the city's growing automobile con-<lb/>
gestion. Burle Marx executed his plan with charac-<lb/>
teristic boldness, engendering a visual dialogue between the park and the baroque landforms that rim the city and its bay.</p>
<p>In <date when="1970">1970</date>, in a second landfill project, he extended his work along Rio's coastline with his design for the promenades and parkways along Copacabana Beach (fig. 13.17). Here, for the palm-tree-edged promenade, he employed a traditional Portuguese paving tech-<lb/>
nique <hi rend="italic">(pedra portuguesa)</hi> to create a black, white, and red mosaic that echoes the undulating line of the nearby surf. In contrast, he designed the roadbed median and sidewalk along the building edge as a series of individually conceived abstract panels with green planting pockets set at irregular intervals within them. The entire strip, including the sandy bathing beach, was thus transformed into a vibrant linear <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> for viewing from the windows of the con-<lb/>
tiguous skyscraper hotels and apartment buildings.</p>
<p>In <date when="1956">1956</date>, the planning of <name type="place">Brazil</name>'s new capital, Bras&#x00ED;lia, began. Many were dismayed that for politi-<lb/>
cal reasons officials did not consult Burle Marx dur-<lb/>
ing the initial planning of this exercise in modernist urban design. Finally, in <date when="1965">1965</date>, he received a commis-<lb/>
sion to work with the architect Oscar Niemeyer on designs for the gardens of the Min-<lb/>
istries of the Army, Justice, and Foreign Affairs. Here as elsewhere he exploited the reflective qualities of pools of water and his own fertile imagination to good effect. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for instance, he reached beyond images derived from Brazil's colonial past to

ones from the Roman colonial past of its mother country, Portugal, drawing upon the gardens of an excavated Roman house in Conimbriga as inspiration for his floating planting beds (figs. 13.18, 13.19).</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Luis Barrag&#x00E1;n and the Landscape of Surrealist Expressionism</hi></head>
<p>Burle Marx developed a visually dynamic style that was an abstract, organic counterpoint to the modern architecture within or adjacent to it, a style only slightly tinged with Surrealism. His contemporary, the Mexican architect Luis Barrag&#x00E1;n (<date when="1902">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1988">1988</date>), with starker Surrealist affinities and more influenced by American regionalist modernism as represented by Frank Lloyd Wright and certain Californian archi-<lb/>
tects, forged an expressive style that wedded domes-<lb/>
tic space with raw, even violent, nature.</p>
<p>Trained in his native Guadalajara, Barrag&#x00E1;n trav-<lb/>
eled for a year and a half in Europe and then left his home city to establish himself in the capital in <date when="1936">1936</date>. He carried with him remembered images from his sojourn in Europe&#x2014;Surrealist paintings, Islamic patios in Spain, and the idyllic Mediterranean gardens of the writer, caricaturist, and illustrator Ferdinand Bac (<date when="1859">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1952">1952</date>) at Les Colombi&#x00E8;res in Menton, <name type="place">France</name>. At Les Colombi&#x00E8;res on the C&#x00F4;te d'Azure, Bac had employed a pastiche of vaguely allusive Mediter-<lb/>
ranean forms in which an Arts and Crafts approach and an Italianate stylistic sensibility were mingled to create a garden of memory and meditation.<ref target="#CH13-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref>Barrag&#x00E1;n, in a similar manner, gave his gardens a certain dreamlike character, imbuing them with memories of vernacular Mexican architecture and the rural land-<lb/>
scape he had known as a child on his family's ranch near the village of Mazamitla. Working in a climate similar to Bac's Mediterranean, he created an archi-<lb/>
tecture that completely fused interior and exterior spatial planning. Thoroughly abreast of modernist developments in his profession, Bar-<lb/>
rag&#x00E1;n forged an indigenous style devoid of stylistic specificity, a spare, stripped-down version of his native architecture that owed a strong debt to the influence of the Bauhaus and Le Corbusier. He particularly wished to avoid designing in the popular "<name type="place">California</name> Colonial" idiom of ornate stucco and red tiles that some affluent Mex-<lb/>
icans had begun to favor.</p>
<p>The practice he established in Mexico City was as a designer-developer, and he built about thirty, mostly speculative houses and small apartment buil-<lb/>
dings during his first four years there. With profits from these, he purchased and remodeled for himself a house in the Tacubaya district, for which he created a garden. He also created behind high buttressed, red-<lb/>
earth-colored walls a strange and enigmatic garden of "aestheticized desolation and decay"<ref target="#CH13-n23"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">23</hi></hi></ref>in San Angel on a property called El Cabr&#x00ED;o at the edge of the Pedre-<lb/>
gal, the lava field south of Mexico City. Before the volcanic eruption of Xictli around 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.,</hi> this was the site of the Aztec ceremonial centers of Cuicuilco and Copilco. Because of its contorted topography, peculiar plant life, and the eerie legends associated with its weird basaltic landscape, the Pedregal was considered by respectable people as a place to be avoided. But Barrag&#x00E1;n's taste for the surreal attracted him to explore and then, beginning in <date when="1944">1944</date>, to buy 865 acres (later increased to 1,250) of this inex-<lb/>
pensive wasteland where he had decided to create a unique modernist garden suburb for prosperous mid-<lb/>
dle-class Mexicans.</p>
<p>With lots one-acre minimum in size, houses occupying no more than 10 percent of the entire area of the subdivision, lava rock and indigenous plant life
<pb n="448"/>
<pb n="448" type="orig"/>
protected from removal, and roads laid out to con-<lb/>
form with the terrain, the San Angel Gardens of the Pedregal were to constitute a Surrealistic celebration of the violent inhuman forces that reside in the larger Mexican landscape. Asserting possession of this land-<lb/>
scape, which bore no trace of colonial occupation but evoked a pre-catastrophe Aztec empire, was also symbolically important at a time when Mexican intellec-<lb/>
tuals, artists, and political leaders were concerned with issues of national identity. To choose a site such as this for domestic purposes was, like Wright's choice of a cantilevered platform over Bear Run for <name type="pname">Edgar J. Kaufmann</name>'s Fallingwater, to state a modernist's con-<lb/>
fidence in technology, even in the face of nature's tur-<lb/>
bulence. It affirmed the idea that humans had reached a point where nature had become a subject of desire and personal dominion rather than an object of awe or admiration. Landscape in this sense meant an inti-<lb/>
mate coupling of architecture and nat-<lb/>
ure. There would be no transition from the artificial to the natural environment through an intermediate zone in which the traditional skills of garden design and hor-<lb/>
ticulture played a significant part.<ref target="#CH13-n24"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">24</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Although the winding streets of El Pedregal were similar to those of nineteenth- and twentieth-<lb/>
century suburbs in the United States, the continuous front lawns of the typical North American suburb were replaced, in conformity with a Mediterranean-<lb/>
derived Latin American tradition, by high walls at the line of the street or sidewalk. For Barrag&#x00E1;n these walls offered opportunities to create slightly mysterious "garden-streets" with "sex appeal."<ref target="#CH13-n25"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">25</hi></hi></ref>The houses behind these walls, however, were rational, function-<lb/>
alist essays in modernism. In their cubic massing, flat roofs, concrete construction, expansive picture win-<lb/>
dows, open floor plans, and interpenetration of indoors and outdoors, they echoed current architec-<lb/>
tural modernism in Europe, the United States, <name type="place">Japan</name>, and other parts of Latin America. Instead of enclos-<lb/>
ing a landscaped patio in the manner of countless Mediterranean-style exemplars, these houses were made simply to emerge out of the rugged landscape (fig. 13.20). In discussing their design of one of the Pedregal properties, Barrag&#x00E1;n's collaborator, Max Cetto, spoke of the lava ridge that partially defined the edge of the swimming pool and all but dove into the living room as "the master key" that "made the house click."<ref target="#CH13-n26"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">26</hi></hi></ref>Here, instead of the house's extending into the landscape by means of axial relationships, the land-<lb/>
scape appears to be extending itself into the house.</p>
<p>Cetto was a German emigr&#x00E9; modernist, and the style of functionalist architecture that he and Bar-<lb/>
rag&#x00E1;n professed, with its smooth, unadorned, white, planar surfaces, contrasted powerfully with the tor-<lb/>
tuous dark-gray basalt. The same mixture of spare, open-plan modernism and dramatic siting can be found in the work of the Austrian-born American architect Richard Neutra (<date when="1892">1892</date>&#x2013;<date when="1970">1970</date>), especially in the house he designed in <date when="1946">1946</date> for <name type="pname">Edgar J. Kaufmann</name> in Palm Springs, <name type="place">California</name> (fig. 13.21). Barrag&#x00E1;n knew of the developments in modern architecture in <name type="place">California</name> and had established a personal friendship with Neutra. Cali-<lb/>
fornian landscape architects such as Thomas Church and Garrett Eckbo were forging a regional modernism that drew upon factors similar to those in Mexico: Hispanic cultural heritage, starkly beautiful natural scenery, and a climate that fostered luxuriant vegetation. Barrag&#x00E1;n's residential landscapes were meant to be, like theirs, private realms in which modernism was informed by vernacular traditions, places where garden and house merged to accom-<lb/>
modate an informal lifestyle, and spaces of refuge and retreat from the turmoil of modern life.</p>
<p>This is eloquently evident at San Cristobal, an estate on the outskirts of Mexico City where Thor-<lb/>
oughbred horses are raised and trained (fig. 13.22). Barrag&#x00E1;n's only remaining legacy that has not been severely altered, this complex of house, swimming pool, stable, and horse pool is a poetic meditation on his childhood memories of the rural village of Maza-<lb/>
mitla, as well as an abstract composition of great sophistication and refinement in which color plays a role similar to that in the works of Color Field
<pb n="449"/>
<pb n="449" type="orig"/>
painters such as Mark Rothko (<date when="1903">1903</date>&#x2013;<date when="1970">1970</date>). Here as elsewhere the architect gave his austere, unorna-<lb/>
mented architecture warmth and animation as well as a Surrealist intensity by his use brilliant pinks and fuchsias against which the complementary green tones of the landscape act as a foil.</p>
<p>In terms of physical climate and a cultural cli-<lb/>
mate hospitable to bold gestures and innovation, Mex-<lb/>
ico and southern <name type="place">California</name> are closely related. Both places are conducive to the use of a Mediterranean plant palette and the interweaving of indoor and out-<lb/>
door space found in Mediterranean lands. The patio of Spain, with its debt to Islamic models, and the log-<lb/>
gia and casino of <name type="place">Italy</name>, where villa owners had pio-<lb/>
neered the art of open-air dining and entertaining, were forerunners of the paved, well-furnished garden court and terrace with pool and adjacent lanai.</p>
<p>In <name type="place">California</name>, in the altered economic and social structure of the post&#x2014;Great Depression years, an informal way of life stressing low maintenance require-<lb/>
ments, casual dress, easy hospitality on the part of hosts without servants, and a proclivity for home-<lb/>
centered recreation contributed to the development of the modernist garden in <name type="place">California</name>. <hi rend="italic">Sunset,</hi> an early lifestyle magazine published in Menlo Park, <name type="place">Califor-<lb/>
nia</name>, and directed to western homeowners, promoted this agreeable mode of living and the flow between indoors and outdoors that it implied. It found a ready audience among the eastern and midwestern migrants pouring into the rapidly growing state. As David Streatfield, an authority on <name type="place">California</name>'s gar-<lb/>
dens, remarks, "The new garden designs united indoor and outdoor space to create a setting for a relaxed, often hedonistic way of living [in which] gar-<lb/>
dens were fully used as outdoor rooms."<ref target="#CH13-n27"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">27</hi></hi></ref>It was a Beaux-Arts-trained landscape architect open to experimentation who was able to make the creative leap from stylistic imitation and reinterpretation of Span-<lb/>

<p>Thomas Church (<date when="1902">1902</date>&#x2013;<date when="1978">1978</date>) grew up in southern <name type="place">Cal-<lb/>
ifornia</name>. He earned a landscape architecture degree from the University of <name type="place">California</name> at <name type="place">Berkeley</name> in <date when="1922">1922</date>, pursued further studies at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and traveled extensively, studying Spanish and Italian garden design on a six-month fel-<lb/>
lowship in <date when="1927">1927</date>. Thus trained in the prevailing Beaux-<lb/>
Arts curriculum, he began a long and successful practice centered primarily upon residential land-<lb/>
scapes, receiving commissions in both the Bay Area and southern <name type="place">California</name>. Florence Yoch (<date when="1890">1890</date>&#x2013;<date when="1972">1972</date>) had begun to transform her style of eclectic original-<lb/>
ity into one that was more abstract and informal with the design in <date when="1936">1936</date> of a poolside garden for the film director George Cukor. Church, like Yoch, was capa-<lb/>
ble of making traditional-style gardens that were aes-<lb/>
thetically pleasing and functionally satisfying, which is what he did for a growing roster of clients through-<lb/>
out the <date when="1930">1930</date>s. Like Yoch, he realized that a landscape designer could make a virtue of a small lot by ignor-<lb/>
ing the tenets of his training and adopting the aesthetic principles being pioneered by modern architects and artists. On a second visit to Europe in <date when="1937">1937</date> he saw the work of Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto (<date when="1898">1898</date>&#x2013;<date when="1976">1976</date>) as well as that of many modern painters and sculptors.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late <date when="1930">1930</date>s, Church began to employ line, color, and texture in a bold and original manner. His use of shifting, asymmetrical axes rather than the balanced, geometrically oriented ones of Neo-<lb/>
classical design gave him the freedom to organize space in new ways. He became a master at harmonizing the angular geometries of architectural design with flow-<lb/>
ing, curvilinear forms. A beach garden in Aptos, <name type="place">Cali-<lb/>
fornia</name>, shows clearly his understanding of ground-plane line as a means of defining space in a manner that energizes both the delineated, contained area and the more natural surrounding terrain (fig. 13.23). At this Pacific Coast beach house designed by Hervey Parke Clark, Church merged interior and exte-<lb/>
rior space so skillfully that he earned a reputation among architects as an ideal collaborator on site planning. As attentive to the lives and desires of his clients as to the conditions of the site, he conceived plans that were both functional and artistic. The pattern and tex-<lb/>
ture of paving or decking and the manner in which the texture, scale, and structure of plants unite hard and soft surfaces is the hallmark of a Church landscape.</p>
<p>Church's first book, <hi rend="italic">Gardens Are for People</hi> (<date when="1955">1955</date>), adopts the tone of a professional offering common-<lb/>
sense advice to homeowners. It gives excellent instruc-<lb/>
tion on how to appreciate visually the natural assets of a property and how to make the most of it by ori-<lb/>
enting the plan to desirable sun angles and wind expo-<lb/>
<pb n="450"/>
<pb n="450" type="orig"/>
sures, while considering scenic view lines, topogra-<lb/>
phy, and existing vegetation. Church pointed out how things had changed within a single generation: Garages had been absorbed into the house; drinks on the terrace had replaced tea in the parlor; modest attire had given way to bikini sunbathing; the circular carriage-turnaround entry court had been replaced by the automobile driveway; a service area for prop-<lb/>
agating and potting plants and composting weeds had become a requirement in an era of do-it-yourself gar-<lb/>
deners; gunite and plastic swimming pools had made a former luxury commonplace; and plant-filled nurs-<lb/>
eries and a scientific horticultural industry had grown up to serve the average homeowner. The prescrip-<lb/>
tions he offered stress the means of integrating house and garden so that they constitute a unified living space. They continually directed attention to the func-<lb/>
tional requirements of the entire family and its guests.</p>

</figure>
<p>With the increasing popularity of home enter-<lb/>
tainment, Church sought to dramatize the point of arrival even in modest houses, stressing the role of attractive forecourt paving and planting as a means of welcoming guests. He also believed that a gener-<lb/>
ous scale for the vestibule would signal the hospital-<lb/>
ity visitors were to receive as they proceeded into the the house and its garden. Increasing the house's ambi-<lb/>
ence of cordiality sometimes involved removing heavy foundation plantings to give it a cleaner, more inviting appearance. Conscious of maintenance requirements in an era of rising labor costs, Church configured gardens with open centers and broad strips of grass that could be easily mowed.</p>
<p><name type="place">California</name>'s climate made the swimming pool an especially appealing garden amenity and its sur-<lb/>
rounding paved area a center for family life and entertaining friends outdoors. Church's best known work, the Donnell Garden in Sonoma, which he designed in <date when="1948">1948</date>, contains a kidney-shaped swim-<lb/>

<p>Modern sculpture, like modern painting, served as an inspiration for early modernist landscape archi-<lb/>

<p>Church remained stylistically versatile, always taking his cues from the client, considering his or her preferences, personal and family requirements, and the conditions of the site. He never entirely aban-<lb/>
doned his Beaux-Arts training, employing past styles or motifs as he deemed appropriate and in response to his clients' tastes. For some of his Bay Area clients living in town houses as well as those in Santa Bar-<lb/>
bara where there was a strong Italianate and Spanish Colonial design tradition, he drew upon his know-<lb/>
ledge of historic landscape idioms (fig. 13.26). Though destined, like Fletcher Steele, by the culture and edu-<lb/>
cation of his time to straddle two design eras, he nevertheless transformed himself into a modernist of conviction, sharing many of the ideas of a slightly younger generation of land-<lb/>
scape architects that included fellow Californian Garrett Eckbo.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Garrett Eckbo's Landscapes for Living</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Garret Eckbo</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="2000">2000</date>) grew up in a town on Alameda Island in <name type="place">San Francisco</name> Bay. He studied landscape architecture at the University of <name type="place">California</name> in <name type="place">Berkeley</name> and Harvard's School of Graduate Design. At Harvard he met Daniel Urban Kiley and James Rose, classmates who were, like him, sufficiently pro-<lb/>
gressive in their social attitudes to sense that the pro-<lb/>
gram they were being offered was designed to serve the demands of a dwindling elite and did not deal with the needs of an industrialized, democratic soci-<lb/>
ety. Joseph Hudnut, the dean of the school, had recently brought Walter Gropius (<date when="1883">1883</date>&#x2013;<date when="1969">1969</date>) to head the architecture department, and with him the teach-<lb/>
ing agenda of the Bauhaus, with its emphasis upon large social issues and the abandonment of historic styles for functionalist design and industrial materi-<lb/>
als. However, the landscape architecture department at Harvard retained its Beaux-Arts curriculum, which Henry Hubbard and Theodora Kimball's textbook, <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design</hi> had codified in <date when="1917">1917</date>.<ref target="#CH13-n29"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">29</hi></hi></ref>As Reuben Rainey points out, Hub-<lb/>
bard and Kimball's method united several approaches. It called for Beaux-Arts, or formal, planning as a means of uniting house and garden along continuing axes, then recommended an Olmstedian naturalistic, or informal, design for the remainder of the property, often as a means of melding it with the larger land-<lb/>
scape. A transitional lawn was proposed to mediate the stylistic contrast between these zones.</p>
<p>Eckbo was inspired by his own sense of possi-<lb/>
bilities derived from living and working in a less tra-<lb/>
dition-bound atmosphere than the Atlantic seaboard and by the current Zeitgeist&#x2014;a heady mixture of jazz, film, fashion, industrial design, New Deal social progressiveness, the recently arrived automobile cul-<lb/>
ture, and the growing acceptance of European mod-<lb/>
ern art and architecture in America. Like his friends Rose and Kiley, he worked diligently while chafing at the limitations of Harvard's conservative approach to landscape architecture. The three probably read with keen interest the articles of the well-traveled Fletcher Steele, whose descriptions of modernist French gardens opened a window upon innovative alternatives to their program of study. They formed a receptive audience for Christopher Tunnard's <hi rend="italic">Gar-<lb/>
dens in the Modern Landscape</hi> when it appeared in <date when="1938">1938</date>.</p>
<p>Eckbo saw the potential of landscape design for serving a middle-class clientele. He thought of the modest row house and the suburban subdivision with its small front yards and backyards as interesting chal-<lb/>
lenges, and he was skilled at manipulating spatial organization to maximize the visual interest and pleas-<lb/>
urable use of an entire property. He explored these possibilities while still at Harvard in a student project comprising a city block of eighteen equal-size town-<lb/>
house lots in which he demonstrated a synthesis of curvilinearity and angularity similar to the one found in Church's Aptos beach house. Landscape historian Marc Treib draws an instructive parallel between Eckbo's compositions and the work of the modern painters Wassily Kandinsky (<date when="1866">1866</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944">1944</date>), Kasimir Malevich (<date when="1878">1878</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935">1935</date>), and L&#x00E1;szl&#x00F3; Moholy-Nagy (<date when="1895">1895</date>&#x2014;<date when="1946">1946</date>).<ref target="#CH13-n30"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">30</hi></hi></ref>The cheerful, Jazz Age rhythms and explosive visual energy set up by the counterplay of geometric and "organic" lines and shapes in their paintings could inspire someone who wanted to sub-<lb/>
stitute the shaping of space as a central compositional principle for the arrangement of views along static, single-perspective axes. In borrowing the free-flowing
<pb n="452"/>
<pb n="452" type="orig"/>
lines of abstract painting for his plans Eckbo found a means of creating a sense of mobile dynamism in the landscape, which had been impossible within the con-<lb/>
fines of Beaux-Arts spatial composition.</p>
<p>At the same time, the inspiration of architecture as derived from Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavil-<lb/>
ion remained influential in Eckbo's work.<ref target="#CH13-n31"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">31</hi></hi></ref>With its grid of eight cruciform columns set on a raised ter-<lb/>
race, the Barcelona Pavilion organizes space in a way that is clear and yet ambiguous. Here, Mies established a modular system that performed the functions of framing the structure and supporting the roof, giving underlying mathematical order to the building, and at the same time freely modulating the interior space by positioning non-load-bearing walls as freestanding screens, articulating occupational zones without defining them precisely. The spatial continuum thus created gives an impression of uninterrupted flow. This type of construction also made possible the cur-<lb/>
tain wall composed of panels of glass or a combina-<lb/>
tion of glass and opaque cladding hung in front of a steel frame. Because space is contained but not defined within these glass walls, there is no unequivocal sep-<lb/>
aration between indoors and outdoors and no single point within the building that can be called its center.</p>
<p>Eckbo returned to <name type="place">California</name> to establish his practice, and at Menlo Park, where he designed a gar-<lb/>
den in <date when="1940">1940</date>, he acknowledged his debt to Mies, plac-<lb/>
ing straight and curvilinear hedges in a manner he termed "a kind of de Stijl-van der Rohe planning," which served as a means of "baffling of garden space ... to increase sense of volume" (fig. 13.27).<ref target="#CH13-n32"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">32</hi></hi></ref> As in Mies's Barcelona Pavilion, the garden has an ordering geometric grid&#x2014;the pear orchard into which it was set&#x2014;and well-emphasized rectangular boundaries.</p>

</figure>
<p>Above all, like Church, Eckbo wanted to focus on domestic human needs and the humanized land-<lb/>
scape that was expanding with the population growth of <name type="place">California</name>. He called his first book <hi rend="italic">Landscape for Liv-<lb/>
ing.</hi> Published in <date when="1950">1950</date> when his reputation was well established and illustrated with the work of his office, it implied the role of human beings as partners with nature, realizing their legitimate needs through sci-<lb/>
ence and technology rather than basing their spatial arrangements upon historic styles reflecting the aspi-<lb/>
rations and needs of people in other times and places.</p>
<p>After returning to <name type="place">California</name> and before setting up a private practice, Eckbo had worked for more than four years for the Farm Security Administration designing fifty landscape plans for camps built to house 225 to 350 families of migrant and permanent agricultural workers. His concern for ordinary humanity was expressed in this context in the inter-<lb/>
esting spatial arrangements and varied palette of veg-<lb/>
etation he provided, which probably offered some greater sense of place and therefore an element of psychological comfort to the populations living in the otherwise unremarkable surroundings of the camps of trailers and spartan temporary housing. <hi rend="italic">Landscape for Living</hi> illustrates his plans for several of these camps along with some of his designs for single-family resi-<lb/>
dences, campuses, parks, and tract-housing, selected from a portfolio that amounted to more than a thou-<lb/>
sand commissions during his years of practice.</p>
<p>As subsequently developed by Ian <name type="pname">McHarg</name> and the landscape planners he trained at the University of Pennsylvania, one approach to landscape architecture was through environmental science (see Chapter Fif-<lb/>
teen). For Eckbo and other landscape functionalists of his generation, science was more a matter of pro-<lb/>
fessional perspective, a questioning approach to design problems, the discipline of asking the theo-<lb/>
retical "why" as well as the practical "how." Wishing to advocate no style and to be an heir to all historic styles, Eckbo created his own design vocabulary to express the dynamic aspect of modernity, his prefer-<lb/>
ence for areal over axial design, and his commitment to democratic values. Even in such structures as gar-<lb/>
den pavilions, his emphasis was upon space, not mass. He saw plants as upthrusting verticals, sculptural objects, and vegetative texture, and for him they were a means of defining space, not an end in themselves. By contrast, he saw rocks as being pulled by gravity toward the center of the earth, and he sometimes used groupings of these to anchor and stabilize parts of his design. Like Church and other landscape archi-<lb/>
tects in <name type="place">California</name>, he designed many pools in the shape of amoebas, kidneys, and boomerangs. In his designs the pool became "a positive space-organizing element which controls physical movement."<ref target="#CH13-n33"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">33</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>In <date when="1956">1956</date>, when the Aluminum Corporation of <name type="place">America</name> (Alcoa) asked Eckbo to develop a landscape plan promoting the use of this modern metal in the garden, he decided to create the Aluminum Garden
<pb n="453"/>
<pb n="453" type="orig"/>
on his own property in Wonderland Park, a subdivi-<lb/>
sion in the Hollywood Hills above Laurel Canyon. The subdivision was situated on a steeply terraced slope, and Eckbo's contribution to its planning resulted in successive layers of vegetation along the side of the canyon and a unified appearance rather than the fragmented look characteristic of other suburban devel-<lb/>
opments. Until his death in <date when="2000">2000</date>, Eckbo remained a fierce and opinionated advocate of the "social-cultural-<lb/>
natural approach" to landscape design.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel Urban Kiley's Synthesis of FRenCH Influence and Miesian Modernism</hi></head>
<p>In contrast to Eckbo, whose experimental approach to landscape architecture was fostered by the inno-<lb/>
vative, freewheeling culture of <name type="place">California</name> and by his commitment to low-cost housing for the mass soci-<lb/>
ety, <name type="pname">Daniel Urban Kiley</name> (b. <date when="1912">1912</date>) became increasingly drawn to Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre's principles of French sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century garden design. This was apparent after <date when="1955">1955</date> when <name type="pname">Mr. and Mrs. J. Irwin Miller</name> chose him to work in collaboration with architect <name type="pname">Eero Saarinen</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1961">1961</date>) on the design of their house and garden in Columbus, Indiana (fig. 13.28). Posted overseas in <date when="1945">1945</date> during his military duty, Kiley was able to tour European gardens for the first time, and his exposure to the masterpieces of Le Notre made a lasting impression upon him. At the same time, he shared with his former classmates Eckbo and Rose a reverential fascination with the Barcelona Pavilion.</p>
<p>In <date when="1955">1955</date>, when hired by the Millers to work with his friend Saarinen, Kiley had already been practicing for nineteen years, using a vocabulary of multiple, shifting axes and free-form, nonorthogonal, areal def-<lb/>
initions similar to that of Eckbo and Rose. Now, hav-<lb/>
ing discovered his affinity for Le N&#x00F4;tre and being given the opportunity to work with an architect who shared his appreciation of Mies van der Rohe's asymmetrical but rhythmically balanced way of organizing space by means of freestanding walls set in overlapping planes within a modular grid, he changed course.<ref target="#CH13-n34"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">34</hi></hi></ref>Hence-<lb/>
forth, he practiced a form of modern landscape archi-<lb/>
tecture that married the classical geometrical planning principles of the French master with the dynamically ambiguous yet elegantly ordered spatial concepts of the German architect. In Mies's work architectural space had the appearance of being no longer con-<lb/>
tained. Space for Mies was an infinity-implying cont-<lb/>
inuum similar to that of Le N&#x00F4;tre's gardens, whose axes were metaphors for Descartes's principle of <hi rend="italic">res extensa,</hi> or the indefinite extension of the universe (see Chapter Five). As landscape architect Gregg Bleam points out, "Perhaps more than any other architect of his time, Mies represented a synthesis of what would seem to be the conflicting conceptions of neoclassi-<lb/>
cism and modernism."<ref target="#CH13-n35"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">35</hi></hi></ref>Kiley, like Frank Lloyd Wright and Christopher Tunnard, found inspiration in Japan-<lb/>
ese design, where a similar underlying asymmetrical compositional balance and continuous, interpene-<lb/>

<p>Organized as a series of separate but overlap-<lb/>
ping zones, Kiley's functional and ornamental garden spaces carry the centrifugal movement of Saarinen's plan for the house into the surrounding landscape. The house, placed within a large square of their com-<lb/>
bined grid plan, is defined on three sides by clipped arborvitae hedges planted in a staggered pattern rather than as a single continuous line. Around the house are
<pb n="454"/>

a series of geometrically ordered gardens reminiscent of the <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> and <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> of Le N&#x00F4;tre, but they do not employ Le N&#x00F4;tre's axial symmetries. Freely arranged within their own grid in a manner that complements Saarinen's pinwheel disposition of the elements of the house, these geometrical garden spaces flow fluidly and expand outward. To define the remaining side of the square Kiley placed a honey locust <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> adjacent to the house, with a platform terrace at either end for the display of sculpture (fig. 13.29).</p>

<p>For the platform terrace at the north end the Millers chose a reclining female figure in bronze by Henry Moore. At the other end of this <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e,</hi> they installed a sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz. Stairs lead down to a lawn that slopes toward the floodplain beside the Flatrock River. Trees planted both in regu-<lb/>
lar configurations and naturalistic clumps form walls on either side of the lawn. Some of the Miller garden's finest effects are due to the clients' horticultural knowl-<lb/>
edge, original plant selections, and intelligent replant-<lb/>
ing over the years. These include the entrance drive planted as an <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> of horse chestnuts to remind Miller of the chestnut <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> he had admired in French gar-<lb/>
dens when he was a graduate student in the <date when="1930">1930</date>s; the weeping beeches in the front entry and on the terrace on the western side of the living room where they serve the function of exterior draperies; the planting of a glen of redbud trees outside the dining room; the substitution of red maples for the row of sycamores in the <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> leading to the river; and the installation of willows, in the meadow near the water.</p>
<p>Kiley's cool reinterpretation of the Beaux-Arts French Neoclassical heritage along lines suggested by the architecture of Mies van der Rohe made him a logical partner for the high-style modern architects who received commissions to build prestigious build-<lb/>
ings that served as cor-<lb/>
porate status symbols. His important contributions in this area in the later years of his career illustrate the growing importance of corporations in shaping both the urban and suburban landscape and their financial ability to supersede local governments as providers of attractive public spaces. From General Motors to Pepsico to Disney to Exxon and Time-Life, big companies have played an increas-<lb/>
ingly large role both directly and indirectly in the devel-<lb/>
opment of the American landscape. Large institutions such as the Ford Foundation and Lincoln Center, both clients of Kiley's, have adopted the same understated Olympian grandeur as corporations in creating an image through architecture and landscape design</p>
<p>Within the discipline of an abstract geometri-<lb/>
cal order, Kiley seeks the sensuously grand gesture. Like his contemporary, <name type="pname">Lawrence Halprin</name> (see Chap-<lb/>
ter Fifteen), he is interested in extending the expres-<lb/>
sive potential of both still and animated water in reflecting pools, fountains, and cascades. His archi-<lb/>
tectural imagination and ability to think boldly in terms of scale and spatial arrangement are qualities that have made him a congenial collaborator with some of the most eminent architects of the twenti-<lb/>
eth century, including Louis Kahn, Eero Saarinen, <name type="pname">I. M. Pei</name>, and <name type="pname">Kevin Roche</name>. In <name type="place">Dallas</name>, <name type="place">Texas</name>, he worked with <name type="pname">Peter Ker Walker</name> in designing Fountain Place, a large water garden built in conjunction with the Pei firm's Allied Bank Tower (fig. 13.30). Here, he planted bald cypress trees in circular concrete tubs set accord-<lb/>
ing to a grid within a broadly stepped cascade, which is further animated by 263 bubbler fountains placed in staggered rows between the trees. The cooling effect and pleasant roar of the sparkling, tree-shaded water, together with a grid of fountain jets that play according to various computer-programmed patterns, have made this corporate gift of public space a much-<lb/>
appreciated popular attraction.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">James Rose's Functionalist and Zen Approach</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">James Rose</name> (<date when="1910">1910</date>&#x2013;<date when="1991">1991</date>) used a caustic pen and an original and deliberately unconventional eye to chal-<lb/>
lenge established taste and convention. He found a forum for his ideas in the magazine <hi rend="italic">Pencil Points</hi> (later <hi rend="italic">Progressive Architecture</hi>) where he coauthored three articles with <name type="pname">Kiley</name> and <name type="pname">Eckbo</name> and also submitted pieces of his own. The freshness of his opinionated prose and perspective on landscape design won him an instant sympathetic readership, especially among architects. Rose's mission throughout his career was to create an intimate relationship between human
<pb n="455"/>
<pb n="455" type="orig"/>
beings, nature, and architecture. This aspiration drew him into a close friendship with Christopher Tunnard. Like the architect Richard Neutra, Rose considered the separation between indoors and outdoors as a series of transparent planes, and his interlocking of exterior and interior forms promoted spatial fusion.</p>
<p>Rose compartmentalized garden space, always with a light hand to allow it visual flow. He did this sometimes with screens of modular wood-framed panels containing a plastic-impregnated wire mesh, sometimes with translucent plastic Japanese shoji screens, sometimes minimally with vertical strings of nylon parachute cord strung along a plane at intervals, sometimes with panels of twisted, slatted bamboo, or sometimes with the slender trunks of white birch trees (fig. 13.31). These screens filtered light and enriched the garden with their own pattern and that of silhou-<lb/>
etted tree branches. Overhead, Rose's trellises carried modular grid patterns into the garden, supporting vines and framing the sky Sometimes these extended horizontal roof lines; at others they acted as free-<lb/>
standing open-air awnings, which were often canted skyward, giving the garden a jaunty angularity. His ground-plane patterns and plant forms combined with those of the vertical and horizontal planes above to create a three-dimensional composition with a com-<lb/>
bination of spatial definition and ambiguity.</p>
<p>Rose had a craftsman's aesthetic sensibility and a spiritual bent, which he nourished by frequent trips to <name type="place">Japan</name>, and at home, by the practice of Zen Bud-<lb/>
dhism. The garden was, for him, both a functional space and a place for reverie. For this reason the pri-<lb/>
vate garden, not the large-scale landscape, was his cho-<lb/>
sen m&#x00E9;tier. With a less extensive practice than either Kiley or Eckbo, Rose's method of approaching each commission was a highly personal one and involved his presence on the site much more than at a drafting table. He liked to shape his landscapes improvisa-<lb/>
tionally, and he often participated in their long-term maintenance. No other modern landscape designer gave as much attention to ground-plane texture as Rose did, and his compositions in gravel, river-worn rocks, flagstones, ground covers, and shrubs are mas-<lb/>
terful essays in landscape craftsmanship (fig. 13.32).</p>
<p>In <date when="1952">1952</date>, Rose designed his own small house in Ridgewood, <name type="place">New Jersey</name>. He used it as a protest against the subsidiary role the landscape architect was usu-<lb/>
ally assigned by the architect and subdivision devel-<lb/>
oper. In his house, according to Rose, "The landscape is of the house instead of attached to it, and the space is one."<ref target="#CH13-n36"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">36</hi></hi></ref>We can only speculate on what the appear-<lb/>
ance of the American suburb might be today if the prescriptions of Rose and Eckbo for site planning and the integration of architecture and landscape in a sin-<lb/>
gle design process had been broadly influential.</p>

<p>Society is influenced, but rarely led, by visionaries. The urge to regulate, systematize, and follow is too strong. Legislation creates town building codes, and banks and federally sponsored loan programs create require-<lb/>
ments for mortgage financing that stifle deviation from standardized norms. With some exceptions such as <name type="pname">James Rouse</name> (<date when="1915">1915</date>&#x2013;<date when="1996">1996</date>), the developers who shaped <name type="place">America</name> in the second half of the twentieth century proved to be much less socially minded than the regional planners and landscape architects of the first half, who believed in rational science as a <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> and industrial technology as a positive force for raising the living standards of society through good engineering and design. The dreams of these idealists were soon deflated by the arrival of a future much less agreeable than the one they had imagined. The media, perhaps the most culturally influential area of corpo-<lb/>
rate power, became a growing influence, urging peo-<lb/>
ple toward consumption, and popular entertainment became a mass industry affecting every corner of soci-<lb/>
ety. The manufacturers of the private automobile, the vanguard of consumer marketing, proved particularly adept at influencing government decision- making and the authorization of funding for highways. In the late twentieth century, private property as commodity, leisure as lifestyle, and the automobile as the domi-<lb/>
nant mode of transportation had a profound effect upon landscape, especially in America.</p>

<note xml:id="CH13-n15" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="bold">15.</hi></seg><p> Tunnard included an illustration of Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye at Poissy in <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the Modern Landscape</hi> with this quote from the architect: "I shall place this house on columns in a beautiful corner of the countryside; we shall have twenty houses rising above the long grass of a meadow where cattle will continue to graze. Instead of the superfluous and detestable clothing of garden city roads and byways, the effect of which is always to destroy the site, we shall establish a fine arterial system running in concrete through the grass itself, and in the open country. Grass will border the roads; nothing will be disturbed&#x2014;neither the trees, the flowers, nor the flocks and herds. The dwellers in these houses, drawn hence through love of the life of the countryside, will be able to see it maintained intact from their hanging gardens or from their ample windows. Their domestic lives will be set within a Virgilian dream."</p>
<p>Here Le Corbusier does not consider who will maintain this Virgilian dream or how, as Tunnard is quick to point out, the larger landscape can be organized in rela-<lb/>
tionship with the house to accommodate the functional needs of human beings. Dryly, he wrote, "Few people want to be condemned to languish at a window and exercise exclusively on a roof garden." See Tunnard, op. cit., p. 79.</p></note>

In an essay, "Space and the Modern Garden," reprinted in Christopher Tunnard's <hi rend="italic">Gardens in the Modern Landscape</hi> (<name type="place">London</name>: The Archi-<lb/>
tectural Press, <date when="1938">1938</date>), he reasoned: "Cer-<lb/>
tainly a harmony between the modern house and its site is more evident when the site, like the house, has escaped both romance and an oppressive formality; but a deep or persuasive unity cannot be attained when one and not the other has submitted to a conscious control of form.

<note xml:id="CH13-n25" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="bold">25.</hi></seg><p> From the text of a <date when="1951">1951</date> speech by Bar-<lb/>

The architectural historian Keith Eggener argues that, in addition to the social con-<lb/>
vention of walled streets and domestic pri-<lb/>
vacy inherited from Mediterranean antiquity, "El Pedregal's walls and gates, and the guards and guardhouses often placed beside them, evince both a sub-<lb/>
stantial concern for security and a meas-<lb/>
ure of ostentatiousness. Walls, gates, and guards not only protect property but also assert its value, its need for protection. Indeed, the security and exclusiveness of this gated, guarded community were among its major selling points; Barrag&#x00E1;n's advertising campaign for El Pedregal placed considerable emphasis on these issues and on those design features that addressed them."</p></note>
