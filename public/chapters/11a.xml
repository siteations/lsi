Giambattista Vico (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x2014; <date when="1744">1744</date>) was a progenitor of the idea that there is no universal, timeless human culture, that remote cultures are entirely different from current ones, and that it is the task of the historian to reconstruct a view of other times and other places with deep, sympathetic imagination. <name type="pname">Johann Gottfried von Herder</name> (<date when="1744">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>) propounded this thesis, which became one of the several strands of Romantic thought. His views helped establish a deeper and more discriminating appreciation of the particular artistic expressions of various cultures, both ones that were remote in time and place and others nearer at hand. The search for roots, for history, so prevalent today even as the entire world streams toward globalization, the latest and most advanced form of cosmopolitanism, is symptomatic of the continuing hold Herder's Romantic thesis has upon our minds.</p><p><name type="pname">John Ruskin</name> (<date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900">1900</date>) was the principal contemporary spokesman for the viewpoint that denied the beneficence of Victorian industrial progress as it was reaching its apogee in late nineteenth-century <name type="place">England</name>. As the precursor of the Arts and Crafts movement, Ruskin articulated its fundamental principles in <hi rend="italic">The Seven Lamps of Architecture</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>). These included architecture for the sake of beauty rather than mere function, honesty of materials, power of impression, inspiration from nature, virile liveliness, commemorative quality, and accordance with universally accepted styles. Ruskin found in medieval styles and their several period and regional inflections an architecture that accorded with these concepts. His influence was strong and long-lasting, helping to account for the naturalistic exuberance of nineteenth-century architectural ornament and the extensive use of animal and vegetable forms in the decorative arts.</p><p>Leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement expressed a similar reaction to machine technology. Perhaps the most articulate and angry among them was the English poet, designer, and socialist lecturer William Morris (<date when="1834">1834</date>&#x2014;<date when="1896">1896</date>), who wrote extensively on the problems associated with industrialization, gave practical application to Ruskin's philosophy, and was closely allied with the group of painters who called themselves the Pre-Raphaelites. Like Ruskin, Morris was a strong proponent of medievalism because of the artisan traditions represented by the craft guilds in the Middle Ages. In <date when="1861">1861</date>, he opened a firm, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Company&#x2014;"Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals"&#x2014;for the production of handcrafted home furnishings. For Morris, an imaginary sojourn in the Middle Ages provided a mental escape from the fast-changing landscape of the nineteenth century. His own highly organic but stylized designs for wallpaper and furniture ornament are akin to medieval patterns. In <date when="1877">1877</date>&#x2014;several years before he published <hi rend="italic">News from Nowhere</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>), his utopian guide to the future&#x2014;Morris founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which focused on the simple beauty of vernacular architecture. Historic preservation remained an important component of the Arts and Crafts movement.</p><p>The Viennese architect and city planner Camillo Sitte was perhaps the most influential opponent of the international urban planning movement that was gathering momentum in the wake of Haussmann's transformation of <name type="place">Paris</name>. Sitte saw emulation of the medieval town square as a place-fixing remedy for the spatially diffuse modern city with its new wide, straight thoroughfares designed for rapid vehicular movement. Arts and Crafts aesthetics, later mingled with a painterly approach borrowed from the Impressionists, had an important influence on architecture in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially in Great Britain. Its Picturesque principles of design called for a<pb n="376"/><pb n="376" type="orig"/>continuation of handcrafted ornamentation of buildings, and this ran counter to the machine-age trend toward a faceless, abstract architecture based on the use of such new building materials as cast iron and glass.</p><p>Inevitably, Ruskin's towering influence was felt in the garden as well. Paxton's Crystal Palace in <name type="place">London</name>, which had so impressed the public in <date when="1851">1851</date>, conspicuously symbolized not only the Industrial Age architecture that Ruskin despised but also the Victorian enthusiasm for showy hybridized plants made possible by glasshouse horticulture. The Arts and Crafts movement that the followers of Ruskin and Morris carried forward numbered among its ranks several landscape professionals who saw the carpet-bedding practices of contemporary gardeners as vulgar rote exercises. William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll were the foremost apostles of a new form of planting, which substituted a more casual and painterly approach employing naturalized shrubs, wildflowers, and perennials for the Victorian gardener's formulaic flower beds. In fractious opposition to Robinson's advocacy of a naturalistic, picturesque style of gardening, the architect Reginald Blomfield set forth an approach oriented more toward architecture than painterly composition, which Blomfield labeled "formal."</p><p>The Edwardian Age now appears as the halcyon twilight of aristocratic pleasures&#x2014;garden parties, croquet games, lawn tennis&#x2014;in verdant settings beautifully maintained by large staffs of gardeners. In the pre-income-tax United States, industrial wealth generated fortunes that Beaux-Arts-trained designers displayed in Italianate gardens of the Country Place Era. The gardens commissioned by latter-day British aristocrats and wealthy Americans for their country estates or the venerable European ch&#x00E2;teaux and villas they and others restored were highly eclectic. Overall, they displayed their owners' and designers' appreciation of historic gardens, reintroduction of intimate scale and spatial enclosure, use of topiary and other "old-fashioned" forms, and loose, naturalistic planting composition in which color plays an important role. Whether derived from Arts and Crafts principles, Italianate and Beaux-Arts formality, or a combination of the naturalistic and the formal, the principal design premise of the Edwardian garden was one of sheer aestheticism; it was an expression of art for art's sake. As such, it represented no ideological set of values and existed only in the context of <hi rend="italic">style.</hi> It was, like the current obsession with expressing history in the landscape, a consumer's option in which period style became itself a dominant cultural value. No longer bound to representation&#x2014;the re-presentation of ideas and beliefs through art&#x2014;design had become a matter of mere choice involving selection among several available historical styles. As such, it no longer expressed the philosophical or literary values of its own age, being instead a graceful echo of forms whose original meaning was now lost.</p><figure xml:id="fig-455"><graphic url="CH11_002.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.1. Kate Greenaway, watercolor illustration for the poem "Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?"</hi></figDesc></figure><p>Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century, the result of Herder's Romantic thesis a century earlier, with its emphasis on historical appreciation as a source of heightened meaning in contemporary life, was firmly rooted. Whether accomplished by talented amateurs or by the emerging professionals who called themselves landscape architects, garden design had become almost entirely self-referential. Landscape designs bore no messages other than those of a sentimental nature &#x2014; remembrances of flowers in Shakespeare's plays; charming evocations of "bygoneness," as in "Queen Anne" period gardens; or images evoking Kate Greenaway's illustrations for children's books (fig. 11.1).</p><p>Because of its association with domesticity, the landscape design field was open earlier than others to women practitioners. In the estate gardens she designed, Beatrix Jones Farrand, one of the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects, drew upon the Arts and Crafts legacy of Jekyll; the work of Thomas Mawson, who combined Arts and Crafts garden style with Beaux-Arts planning principles; and a traveler's first-hand acquaintance with Italian villa gardens. Farrand's contemporary, Ellen Biddle Shipman, who had less opportunity to journey abroad and study examples of European landscape design, created original gardens that complemented the American Colonial Revival architecture then fashionable. In <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place">Florida</name>, landscape designers were especially eclectic, borrowing inspiration from Italian villas and harking to distant echoes of Islamic Spain as they sought to forge regional idioms based upon the sunny Mediterranean-type climate and Hispanic heritage found in these states. In both, a vegetal palette incorporating many species of semitropical plants made gardens exceptionally lush. <name type="place">California</name> designers also looked west across the Pacific, especially to <name type="place">Japan</name>, for inspiration.</p><p>Whether continuing the eclectic tradition of the Edwardians or subscribing to the tenets of modernism, landscape design was now a much more individualistic enterprise than before. Gardening was seen as an expression of personality, the domain of private dreams, and such it remains today, especially in those highly personal landscapes often referred to as "vernacular." The Edwardian landscape's purposes were those of idyllic retreat or recreational refuge from the increasing freneticism of modern life. Being essentially a place of play, it had little concern for representing broadly shared philosophical perspectives or displaying emblems of power. Moreover, Edwardian croquet lawns and tennis courts were but a foretaste of the garden's expanding role as a place of physical recreation, one that was to be extended to society at large by the many new public parks built in the twentieth century. Henceforth, as the old order of social hierarchy faded, its purpose was to serve the general welfare and become a commodity for mass consumption.</p><div type="section"><pb n="377"/><pb n="377" type="orig"/><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">I. Modernity Challenged: Ruskin's Influence, the Past Revalued, and <name type="place">Italy</name>'s Long Shadow</hi></hi></head><p>Baron Haussmann's modernization of the city of <name type="place">Paris</name> during the reign of Napoleon III was but the first example of thorough urban reconfiguration to accommodate the new forces of accelerated movement brought about by the Industrial Age. Elsewhere in the second half of the nineteenth century cities were being similarly transformed. Vienna acquired a belt of fluid urban motion and monumental modern urbanism beginning in <date when="1857">1857</date> when Emperor Franz Josef I ordered the demolition of the fortifications walling the old city. The area of the glacis, the sloped terrain extending in front of the walls, which had long been controlled by the military, became a belt of open space available for new uses. The city, which was then administered by the liberal element of the bourgeoisie, employed the best Viennese architects of the second half of the nineteenth century to create the broad, landscaped Ringstrasse, a beltway with public green spaces and sites for important ecclesiastical, civic, and educational institutions and also for new residential buildings.</p><p>Though employing modern methods of construction, the architects of the Ringstrasse built in a medley of borrowed styles. They applied the Gothic style in designing the Rathaus, an attempt to associate this seat of municipal government with the pre-imperial medieval commune governed by burghers. By contrast, they deemed an early Baroque idiom appropriate for the state theater, the Burgtheater, perhaps because it spoke of the time when commoners were first able to join courtiers in the enjoyment of the dramatic arts. These structures, together with the neo-Renaissance university and the Neoclassical Parliament buildings, the latter built as a gargantuan Greek temple with vastly extended wings, were oriented to the broad expanse of the Ringstrasse. Contrary to the historic models they evoked, these works of architecture stood isolated, lacking the frame of well-defined public space. No medieval or Renaissance squares gave spatial enclosure and foreground perspective to the Rathaus or the university, and no monumental axes found their terminal points in the Burgtheater or the Parliament. Although the buildings were set in generously landscaped space, this further emphasized their isolation, heterogeneousness, and lack of visible containment. It was this loss of urban spatial coherence&#x2014;buildings and public spaces defined and visually enhanced by one another&#x2014;that disturbed Camillo Sitte, the Austrian architect and city planner who sought to stem the tide of cultural disintegration and loss of community as the rich texture of old cities and towns built by human hands began to be superseded by impersonal urban environments created by machine technology.</p><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">Camillo Sitte and the Art of Building Cities</hi></hi></head><p><name type="pname">Camillo Sitte</name> (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903">1903</date>) maintained a historicist vision that was embodied in Picturesque architectural principles, and he sought to stabilize urban space by replicating the square of the medieval and Renaissance townscape. In <date when="1889">1889</date>, he published <hi rend="italic">Der St&#x00E4;dtebau nach seinen kunstlerischen Grunds&#x00E4;tzen</hi>&#x2014;in its English translation, <hi rend="italic">The Art of Building Cities.</hi> This remarkable essay continues still to speak to those who address their attention to cityscapes and who, like Sitte, regret the sacrifice of urban design to traffic engineering and the substitution of technocratic utilitarian planning for artistic principles of urban composition. In forming his critique, Sitte did not quarrel with eclectic architecture, as modernist architects soon would. Instead, he based his argument on an analysis of public spaces in classical and more recent historic times, before planning had been entrusted to government agency officials who had inevitably developed a systematic, formulaic approach to urban design. The Greek agora and the Roman forum had been vital centers of community life, and many of the Italian piazzas had evolved as satisfying assemblages of architecture, sculpture, and open space through an instinctive artistry spanning several generations. Nearer to home, the close-knit town life in the time of craft guilds evoked in <hi rend="italic">The Mastersingers</hi> by <name type="pname">Richard Wagner</name>, a composer whom Sitte greatly admired, provided an image of artisan values and community. Sitte included in his book several instructive diagrams analyzing the configurations of cathedral squares in Nuremberg and other German and Austrian communities (fig. 11.2).</p><figure xml:id="fig-456"><graphic url="CH11_003.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.2. Diagram of the town of Nuremberg, by Camillo Sitte, from <hi rend="italic">The Art of Building Cities.</hi> <date when="1889">1889</date></hi></figDesc></figure><p>One of the first to recognize and articulate the more open character of cities in the modern age as<pb n="378"/><pb n="378" type="orig"/>well as their enlarged size and building scale, Sitte pointed out the failure of rational planning to provide a suitable urban habitat, citing Vienna's wide, windswept thoroughfares furnished with tiny islands for crossing pedestrians, its unenclosed new parks that lacked the feeling of tranquillity and protection found in old palace gardens, its division into blocks that emphasized street frontage at the expense of interior courtyard space, and the design of public squares as reservoirs of traffic, rather than as places for public life. Although he realized that the publication of newspapers diminished one of the functions of the square&#x2014;that of exchanging information&#x2014;and that market stalls had been supplanted by indoor shops, Sitte still believed that artistically arranged public squares were essential elements of community, necessary both visually and spiritually. Like Frederick Law Olmsted, he disliked the relentless grid that ignored topographic considerations and that failed to capture scenic opportunities. Haussmann's <name type="place">Paris</name>, though technocratic in its approach to planning and therefore conducive to the same monotonous banality that was beginning to afflict Vienna and other modernizing cities, was improved in Sitte's eyes by its continuation of the Baroque tradition of terminating axes with monumental buildings, showing that "perspective effects are possible even within the limitations imposed by practical considerations."<ref target="#CH11-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref></p><p>Sitte was willing to make concessions to utility, and he knew that modern cities needed systematic planning with regard to transportation and sanitation. But he deplored the division of the unbuilt city into uniform blocks of land for real-estate speculation. Regarding the composition of public squares, he despised as dull the convention of centering monuments and applying symmetry as a uniform design principle. In short, the formulaic plan was his b&#x00EA;te noire. "Whoever is to succeed in upholding esthetic considerations in urban development must," he declared, "first, realize that practical solutions to traffic problems are not necessarily rigid, unalterable remedies; and secondly, he must be prepared to demonstrate that practical requirements of modern living need not necessarily obstruct artful development."<ref target="#CH11-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref></p><p>In a final chapter, Sitte offered diagrammatic suggestions to enhance the existing Ringstrasse buildings through the reconfiguration of their surroundings as enclosed plazas. But his attempts to define a psychology of place&#x2014;like the opposite approach of his Viennese contemporary the architect Otto Wagner to aggrandize and regularize urban space&#x2014;remained a utopian vision influential only in academic and intellectual circles. As the head of the State Trade School, Sitte advanced his Arts and Crafts ideals from within the government bureaucracy, writing on bookbinding, ceramics, fountain restoration, and other subjects that combined his love of the past with his sense of urgent need for the aesthetic imagination to serve as a redemptive social force within the framework of contemporary capitalism.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">The Victorian War of Styles: William Robinson and Reginald Blomfield</hi></hi></head><p>In the realm of the English garden, William Robinson (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1935">1935</date>) promoted an Arts and Crafts aesthetic at odds with the forces of scientific horticulture driving much of the landscape design in his day. Like Capability Brown, Robinson was a working gardener who rose to a position of exceptional influence. Like John Claudius Loudon, he was effective in reaching a broad audience through the pages of his garden periodicals and books. But although Robinson shared Loudon's encyclopedic botanical knowledge, he saw plants more in artistic than in scientific terms, and he abhorred the Victorian style of carefully displayed specimen plants Loudon had championed and christened the Gardenesque. For Loudon, admiration of an individual plant's form was a consideration equal in importance to its effect with other plants in the landscape, and for flower beds or groupings of trees and shrubs he urged that each be planted near to, but not touching, its neighbor. Robinson, to the contrary, envisioned garden compositions with plants intermingled and sometimes intertwined as in wild nature. His style was within the Picturesque tradition at the time when the Picturesque's potential to create rich and varied scenes had been greatly expanded by the introduction of many new species of flowering plants.</p><p>Robinson's firm opinions on horticultural matters, fluently expressed in peppery prose, soon led him to write for the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle.</hi> He was fortunate in being able to communicate his ideas to an expanding and congenial audience. The tremendous suburban growth around <name type="place">London</name> and other British cities at the end of the nineteenth century took the form of many hundreds of thousands of middle- and working-class homes with garden plots.<ref target="#CH11-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref>With a climate moist and temperate enough to grow a wide range of plant material, with long hours of summer daylight, and with sufficient money in the pockets of enough of its citizens to support a flourishing nursery trade, late Victorian and Edwardian <name type="place">England</name> became a nation of gardeners. Poor cottagers living in old rural villages obtained gifts of cuttings for their gardens, which they arranged randomly with little design forethought. There was, however, considerable charm in the vernacular landscape of cottagers' gardens, and Robinson saw them as a rich source of ideas that sub<pb n="379"/><pb n="379" type="orig"/>urban gardeners could use, particularly after he became acquainted with the garden-artist and craftswoman Gertrude Jekyll, who appreciated cottage gardens as much as he did. The native landscape of fields, hedgerows, and woodland dells offered further inspiration (fig. 11.3). The growing number of field clubs and local scientific societies and the publication of handbooks on wildflowers testified to a broad general interest in nature among the British. Robinson incorporated into his recommendations many ideas gleaned from these sources as well as from his own rambles. Ruskin's view of nature as the root of truth and beauty and his belief in honorable craft as an antidote to crude mechanization added support for Robinson's and Jekyll's Arts and Crafts approach to garden design.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Alpine Flowers for English Gardens,</hi> published in <date when="1870">1870</date>, the same year as <hi rend="italic">The Wild Garden,</hi> told readers that the plants Robinson had seen growing in rocky crevices in the Alps could also flourish in English gardens. The continuing popularity of rock gardens was due in no small part to Robinson's persuasiveness in promoting Alpine horticulture. Other writers had criticized bedding out of plants, promoted a floral version of the Picturesque, and urged gardeners to study wildflowers and to emulate the effects of field and forest, but none had Robinson's flair as a publicist and none was as prolific as he. In <date when="1871">1871</date>, to further his views, he began publishing <hi rend="italic">The Garden,</hi> a long-lived weekly journal to which both Ruskin and Gertrude Jekyll contributed. This was followed by other periodicals: <hi rend="italic">Gardening Illustrated,</hi> begun in <date when="1879">1879</date>; <hi rend="italic">Cottage Gardening,</hi> started in <date when="1892">1892</date>; and <hi rend="italic">Flora and Sylva,</hi> published from <date when="1903">1903</date> until <date when="1905">1905</date>. Graphically well designed and featuring handsome engravings, these magazines provided a platform from which Robinson promoted rock gardens, wild gardening, and herbaceous borders. They provided a forum where he could fulminate against aspects of garden taste that he despised. One was the fashion for topiary, which had been revived in High Victorian gardens, notably Levens Hall and Elvaston Castle, and which was later advocated by Robinson's contemporary, the Ruskinian ecclesiastical architect-turned-gardener <name type="pname">John Dando Sedding</name> (<date when="1838">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>), in <hi rend="italic">Garden-Craft Old and New</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>) (fig. 11.4). Contentious and opinionated, Robinson continued to advance his ideas in his magnum opus, <hi rend="italic">The English Flower Garden</hi> (<date when="1883">1883</date>). Through his conversational, commonsensical style and the vivid pictures he painted with words he won many readers, and the book ran to sixteen editions.</p><p>Robinson was as zealous in his attack upon Reginald Blomfield (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1942">1942</date>), an architect and the author of <hi rend="italic">The Formal Garden in <name type="place">England</name></hi> (<date when="1892">1892</date>), as in his crusade against carpet bedding. Although Blomfield championed a return to the design formality of the English garden in pre-Georgian times, he did not feel that designing in the manner of these old gardens was incompatible with Arts and Crafts principles. His principal argument rested upon the belief that house and garden should be united in a single plan in which landscape space was treated as an extension of the architecture of the house. Robinson, for his part, did not object to geometrical lines in the garden. For him, a rectangular flower bed was, like the rectangular stretcher supporting the canvas on which an artist paints a free-flowing landscape, a convenient shape wherein the gardener's naturalistic effects could be displayed. Both men despised William Andrew Nesfield's revival of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and the Italianate grandeur of the Crystal Palace Park at Sydenham. Blomfield, however, wanted to revive the classicism of Christopher Wren&#x2014;so much so that his style was jokingly called "Wrenaissance"&#x2014;and to return to the garden a sense of enclosure, making it an architectural arrangement of outdoor rooms partitioned by walls and hedges, proportioned in relation to the house, and employing the principles of symmetry in its layout. He perceived the unstructured naturalistic garden as an obstacle to this end. As bluntly opinionated as Robinson, he asserted dogmatically that "to suppose that love of nature is shown by trying to produce the effects of wild nature on a small scale in a garden is clearly absurd; anyone who loves natural scenery will want the real thing; he will hardly be content to sit in his rockery and suppose himself to be among the mountains."<ref target="#CH11-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p><figure xml:id="fig-457"><graphic url="CH11_004.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.3.

Heirs to a now well-established tradition of British literary invective in books and articles on landscape design, Blomfield and Robinson were well matched in the passion with which they espoused their respective views. The word <hi rend="italic">formal,</hi> with its connotation of the geometric style, was the source of some confusion. To Robinson the horticulturist it should apply only "where the plants of a garden are<pb n="380"/><pb n="380" type="orig"/>rigidly set out in geometrical design as in carpet-gardening and bedding-out." It was also for him, as for Blomfield, a synonym for <hi rend="italic">architectural,</hi> and he would confine the architect solely to designing houses and some necessary grading around them. Everything else was to be left to the discretion of the garden designer with his superior knowledge of horticulture and claim to artistic plantsmanship. Eventually the acrimony subsided, and each side could claim victory as Edwardian gardens became alternatively formal and revivalistic or informal and naturalistic. Increasingly, they were places where both geometrical lines and painterly flower borders were at home.</p><figure xml:id="fig-459"><graphic url="CH11_006.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.5.

By good fortune, a young architect, Edwin Landseer Lutyens (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1944">1944</date>), lived near her village of Godalming, just north of Munstead Heath in Surrey, the then-rural southern county that is now a heavily suburbanized part of metropolitan <name type="place">London</name>. Their friendship flourished on both a personal level and as a fruitful collaboration over several years. It was one that embodied both designers' deep respect for rural English vernacular building and gardening idioms. At the heart of their achievement was the conviction Jekyll undoubtedly conveyed to Lutyens regarding the importance of sensitive site planning.</p><p>As a girl, Jekyll read Ruskin's works avidly. Ruskin's deep respect for handicrafts and the artisan worker would remain a chief influence and moral guide for Jekyll the rest of her life. In <date when="1861">1861</date>, the same year William Morris started his crafts firm and a time when higher education was gradually opening to women, Jekyll enrolled in the South Kensington School of Art. Here she learned drawing and color theory and experienced the influence of Owen Jones, a crafts designer and student of Moorish, Italian, and Chinese ornament who had served as superintendent of the Great Exhibition of <date when="1851">1851</date> as well as joint director of decoration for the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. Introductions to both Ruskin and Morris, whose International Exhibition of his firm's craft products she had probably visited in <date when="1862">1862</date>, confirmed her in her course as an artist. She chose to be both a painter and a craftswoman, accepting many commissions for silver jewelry, embroideries, and inlaid woodwork, although, as a well-to-do woman from a prominent family, she could not defy social convention by formally establishing herself in business. In <date when="1876">1876</date>, after her father's death, she went to live with her mother in Munstead House, where, with a nature that craved a large degree of privacy and tranquillity, she was happy to continue her arts and crafts pursuits in the rural quietude of Surrey.</p><p>In <date when="1883">1883</date>, Jekyll purchased a 15-acre triangular plot of land opposite Munstead House, "fifteen acres of the poorest possible soil," the site of her garden and future home, Munstead Wood. Here she began developing a garden of woodland walks. She was severely afflicted by myopia&#x2014;nearsightedness&#x2014;and as this condition progressed, she was forced to abandon even close work. By <date when="1891">1891</date>, her physician's prognosis of further deterioration caused her to throw more of her considerable artistic energy into gardening, which she was already pursuing with passionate interest. With the help of her brother she had taken up photography a few years earlier, and this gave her another visual medium of expression.</p><p>The hyphenated appellation <hi rend="italic">artist-gardener</hi> perfectly suits Jekyll. Her blurry distance vision may possibly have assisted her in conceiving garden schemes less in terms of individual plants than as shapes, textures, and broad masses of color with single varieties often arranged to maximum optical<pb n="381"/><pb n="381" type="orig"/>advantage in long drifts along a diagonal to the path (fig. 11.5). Like the Impressionist Claude Monet (<date when="1840">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1926">1926</date>), who was simultaneously creating his garden at Giverny both as a painterly expression in horticulture and a subject to be painted, Jekyll saw her garden as a series of seasonal scenes, appearing like pictures in a gallery with different exhibitions planned throughout the year. Not for her were Loudon's botanically ordered plant specimens. Glass houses, pridefully displayed in Victorian gardens, were removed in hers to hidden corners to serve purely practical ends. Her gardener's credo, expressed in <hi rend="italic">Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden</hi> (<date when="1914">1914</date>), was deceptively simple:<q>I am strongly of the opinion that the possession of a quantity of plants, however good the plants may be themselves and however ample their number, does not make a garden; it only makes a <hi rend="italic">collection.</hi> Having got the plants, the great thing is to use them with careful selection and definite intention.... it seems to me that the duty we owe to our gardens and to our own bettering in our gardens is so to use the plants that they shall form beautiful pictures.<ref target="#CH11-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></q></p><p>Her easy and engaging style of writing was nurtured by her career as a garden columnist, first with the <hi rend="italic">Guardian Newspaper</hi> and later as a contributor to William Robinson's magazine <hi rend="italic">The Garden,</hi> which she coedited for a brief period following his retirement in <date when="1899">1899</date>. She wrote the section on color for <hi rend="italic">The English Flower Garden,</hi> which was republished in several subsequent editions of Robinson's popular book, and she contributed photographs of plants to serve as the basis of engravings in all editions after the second. In <date when="1899">1899</date>, drawing material from her <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> columns, she published a book of her own, <hi rend="italic">Wood and Garden.</hi> She illustrated it with sixty-five of her own photographs, including many she had taken of cottagers at work in their gardens and woodmen competently felling trees with the time-honored tools she admired. Her prose is sensuous and vivid, and seasonal change, with the rhythm of the agrarian calendar dictating the gardener's rounds, remains a theme in all her books.</p><p>Book publication brought Jekyll increased celebrity and assisted her in building a design practice with her architect, friend, and prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;, Edwin Lutyens. Their common aesthetic grew as he rode with her in a pony cart through the byways of Surrey admiring vernacular architecture. In Lutyens, Jekyll felt she had found someone whom she could trust to provide the elements of architectonic structure and domestic comfort needed to complement her visions of nature perfected. He, in turn, was grateful to his sometimes overbearing, but immensely helpful mentor, who imparted to him her Ruskinian sympathies, Arts and Crafts ideals, and deep appreciation of a vanishing <name type="place">England</name>. His genius lay in his ability to fuse these elements with an architectural style that embodied many of the formal principles enunciated by Blomfield.</p><p>Socially conservative, Jekyll wanted to preserve the old class structure of masters and servants. But far from wishing to make the humble cottages of rural villages disappear from the improved landscape, as had been the case in the eighteenth century when lands were enclosed and great estate gardens such as Stowe created, she was in the vanguard of British heritage preservation. Even as an ancient way of life was succumbing to the modern age of industrialization, she wanted to save its building and craft traditions and to incorporate their techniques of brick, stone, and ironwork, along with the rustic charm of cottage gardens, into the style she and Lutyens were forging together. She also wanted to record the folkways and old agricultural methods that represented a venerable craft tradition even as new farm machinery and aspirations to transcend village poverty were causing these to vanish.</p><figure xml:id="fig-460"><graphic url="CH11_007.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.6. <name type="pname">Gertrude Jekyll</name>, "Cluster Rose in a Cottage Garden."

In <hi rend="italic">Gardens for Small Country Houses</hi> (<date when="1912">1912</date>) Jekyll and her coauthor Lawrence Weaver wrote of the "right relation of the garden to the house," stating that "the connection must be intimate, and the access not only convenient but inviting."<ref target="#CH11-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref>At Munstead Wood, house and garden join in a mutual embrace. The house opens itself to the garden and incorporates the garden into its Paved Court, which is constructed of the same local stone as the house and edged with low boxwood hedges. At the north end of the Paved Court is the Tank Garden, where a rectangular pool is framed by stepped paving and lush plantings of ferns and canna lilies. Semicircular aprons of paving on either side of the pool mark the end of this formal construction where two garden paths, the Nut Walk and the path beside the October Michaelmas daisy border, lead to a Pergola and Summerhouse, beyond which lies Jekyll's 180-foot-(54.9-meter) long Main Flower Border, Garden of Summer Flowers, and Spring Garden.</p><p>The south and west sides of the house face a lawn and the adjoining woodland where, according to Jekyll, "much care has been given to the regions where the one melts into the other."<ref target="#CH11-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> The principal path on the south is a wide grassy way, which Jekyll constructed to have as its focal point a handsome Scotch fir that, being double-stemmed, had not been cut when the property was a woodlot. Masses of rhododendrons carefully selected for their floral color were underplanted with hardy ferns, small andromedas, wild heaths, and the blue-flowered <hi rend="italic">Lithospermum prostratum.</hi> Lesser paths formed a series of woodland walks, along which patches of trillium, drifts of Solomon's seal, and spires of white foxglove enhanced the impression of wild nature in its most generous state.</p><p>Jekyll's camera recorded many beautiful garden pictures at Munstead Wood over the years. Because of her growing reputation as a garden writer and photographer, she met Edward Hudson, the publisher, who, in <date when="1897">1897</date>, launched <hi rend="italic">Country Life,</hi> the first garden magazine<pb n="383"/><pb n="383" type="orig"/>to feature coated paper to enhance the imagery of half-tone photographs. Jekyll began writing for<hi rend="italic"> Country Life</hi> in <date when="1901">1901</date>, and her subsequent books were published under the <hi rend="italic">Country Life</hi> imprint. Although the magazine showcased many great estates, Jekyll's participation added greater horticultural content and a focus upon small country houses, domestic establishments like her own Munstead Wood where the owner substituted for a head gardener in directing the work of a small gardening staff. Her first article described Orchards, the house and garden that she and Lutyens were then completing for her neighbors <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Julia</name> Chance, a virtuosic combination of Lutyens's architectural imagination and Jekyll's painterly sensibility (fig. 11.8).</p><p>In <date when="1898">1898</date>, following the Orchards commission, Lutyens crossed the English Channel to design Les Bois des Moutiers at <name type="place">Varengeville</name> on the Normandy coast for the Anglophile banker <name type="pname">Guillaume Mallet</name> (fig. 11.9).<ref target="#CH11-n8"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">8</hi></hi></ref>Imbued, like Jekyll, with the aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts movement, Mallet sought inspiration for the exquisitely harmonized floral tones of his superb collection of rhododendrons from medieval stained glass as well as from his collection of old embroidered fabrics, mostly clerical vestments.

The restored <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs that we see today at Vaux-le-Vicomte are the work of Henri Duch&#x00EA;ne (<date when="1897">1897</date>) and Achille Duch&#x00EA;ne (<date when="1910">1910</date>) (see fig. 5.4 ). At Champs-sur-Marne the father and son erased th<hi rend="italic">e jardin anglais</hi> that had been superimposed upon a seventeenth-century plan, reestablishing the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi> as two fine panels of flowing arabesques. Recognizing the Duch&#x00EA;nes' expertise in resurrecting this lost art with a particular crispness of line, the ninth duke of Marlborough (<date when="1892">1892</date>&#x2013;<date when="1934">1934</date>) commissioned Achille to restore the north forecourt at Blenheim as a <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden. Duch&#x00EA;ne then went on to design formal gardens to the east and west of the palace, the latter with two water terraces. Perhaps his most successful design was the beautiful restoration of the park surrounding the <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E2;teau</hi> of Courances in Essonne, <name type="place">France</name>, in the years prior to World War I as a small <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and series of spring-fed canals and pools framed by <hi rend="italic">palissades</hi> and noble trees, with a small cascade rippling from the base of a sculpture of a reclining nymph (fig. 11.10).

This three-level garden, a popular stop on the Loire Valley tourist circuit, manages to convey the intricate compartmentalization, meticulous order, and sense of containment within well-defined boundaries that are characteristic of Renaissance design.</p><p>Its <hi rend="italic">potager</hi> is a geometrical <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> composed of nine large squares filled with lettuces and other vegetables of varied hues, arranged in a pattern derived from studying the sixteenth-century ch&#x00E2;teau garden layouts of Jacques Androuet du Cerceau (fig. 11.11, see figs. 4.40, 4.41, 4.42, 4.43, 4.44). The corners of each square are punctuated with the style of trelliswork arbors characteristic of Renaissance gardens, and today these are covered with roses.</p><p>The iconography of Villandry's noteworthy Jardin d'Ornement has more to do with late-nineteenth-century opera or nascent twentieth-century Surrealism than with the themes of Renaissance humanism (fig. 11.12). In one of its four compartments the topiary box represent hearts, flames, and masks symbolizing <hi rend="italic">l'amour tendre,</hi> or tender love; in another butterflies and fans hint of <hi rend="italic">l'amour volage,</hi> fickle love; a third is a labyrinth of hearts denoting <hi rend="italic">l'amour folie,</hi> blind passion; and the last contains sword and dagger<pb n="385"/><pb n="385" type="orig"/>blades characterizing <hi rend="italic">l'amour tragique,</hi> tragic love. In spite of this amusingly original interpretation of Renaissance garden design and perhaps because of a level of maintenance comparable to the time when battalions of gardeners were commonplace, the visitor almost feels transported to a distant age. An <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> of lime trees defines the garden's main axis, which separates the two gardens just described from the Jardin d'Eau above with its verdant lawns, ornamental pool, fountain basins, and canal.</p><p>Jean-Claude-Nicolas Forestier (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2013;<date when="1930">1930</date>), Achille Duch&#x00EA;ne's and Dr. Joachim de Carvallo's contemporary, had a less reactionary temperament and restorationist bent. His was a flexible style that mediated between several trends: a return to Neoclassical formality, the legacy of <hi rend="italic">the jardin anglais,</hi> an Arts and Crafts aesthetic, and the innovations of modernism. As an employee of the <name type="place">Paris</name> Parks and Promenades administration after <date when="1887">1887</date>, Forestier restored Thomas Blaikie's late-eighteenth-century <hi rend="italic">jardin-anglais</hi> on the grounds of Bagatelle as a public park, leaving in place some of the garden's remaining<hi rend="italic"> fabriques</hi> and reintroducing French formality in the more architectonic lines of the new perennial and rose gardens (fig. 11.13). Forestier was also responsible for restoring Sceaux, the masterful landscape Le Nôtre had created for Colbert (see fig. 5.16). But his style ranged beyond that of French and English inspiration, incorporating such Islamic and Mediterranean features as patios and patterned tiles. This eclecticism was nourished by Forestier's international landscape practice. Like Duch&#x00EA;ne, Forestier grappled with the challenge of designing gardens for the relatively small-scale private properties of a still wealthy but less landed clientele. His ability to amalgamate an Arts and Crafts horticultural palette, formal elements derived from Renaissance garden tradition, and Mediterranean and Islamic motifs in an original manner can be seen in the garden he designed for the Parque de Montjuich (Montju&#x00EF;c) in Barcelona in <date when="1918">1918</date> (fig. 11.14).</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">The Influence of Renaissance Italy in England and America</hi></hi></head><p>The merger of an Arts and Crafts aesthetic with Neoclassicism, eclectic creativity, and respect for regional materials and local scenery was part of a general stylistic trend adopted by various architects, landscape designers, and aesthetes well into the twentieth century. In addition to countering industrialization and mass production with artisan workmanship, the Arts and Crafts movement in Great Britain was, as we have seen, nationalistic, a preservationist effort to uphold English vernacular traditions. Even so, this commitment to "Englishness" was being undermined by Beaux-Arts influence in much the same way as the American style of Olmsted and Vaux was being challenged by Daniel Burnham and the Neoclassical architects who projected a new monumentalism and rectilinear axiality in American architecture and city planning.</p><figure xml:id="fig-467"><graphic url="CH11_014.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.13.

They saw the sixteenth-century and early-seventeenth-century villas of <name type="place">Italy</name> as models to emulate. Peto developed Italian themes in his own garden at Ilford Manor, near Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, gaining the admiration of Jekyll, who included some of his design details in her book <hi rend="italic">Garden Ornament</hi> (<date when="1918">1918</date>). At Ilford Manor and in the gardens he designed for clients, Peto terraced slopes, marked grade changes with balustrades atop retaining walls, created graceful staircases with side walls terminating in finial-topped pillars or columns holding antique statuary, and built casinos and colonnades overlooking tanks of water lilies (fig. 11.15). In their sensitive use of native stone; in their employment of a subdued floral palette as a complement to evergreen<pb n="386"/><pb n="386" type="orig"/>shrubs and trees; and in their siting with respect to their surroundings, Peto's gardens demonstrate a discriminating assimilation of Italian themes to English landscape tradition. In several gardens he showed that he could manipulate water, one of the principal ingredients of Italian gardens, with considerable originality. At Hartham Park in Wiltshire, around <date when="1903">1903</date>, he built a long canal and a casino modeled on one of the pair next to the Fountain of the Deluge at the sixteenth-century Villa Lante. At Garinish Island at the head of Bantry Bay in County Cork, <name type="place">Ireland</name>, against the scenic backdrop of Sugarloaf Mountain, he brought the lush vegetation within the sunken garden and its Villa Lante-style pavilion into focus with a rectangular lily pool (fig. 11.16).</p><figure xml:id="fig-470"><graphic url="CH11_017.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.16.

These included Arthur Acton, owner of La Pietra in Florence; Lady Sybil Cutting, who presided over the Villa Medici in Fiesole; and Gertrude Jekyll's older sister Caroline, who married Frederic Eden and with him and advice from Gertrude created an English-inflected Italian garden behind the high walls surrounding their palazzina on the Giudecca in <name type="place">Venice</name>.</p><p>Beginning with <hi rend="italic"><name type="pname">Roderick Hudson</name></hi> (<date when="1875">1875</date>), the novelist <name type="pname">Henry James</name> wrote about the expatriate life of this generation, its high ideals of beauty, and its determination to grasp artistic experience and live a life of connoisseurship.

Their lines softened by lichened stone and overgrown vegetation in a way that was agreeable to eyes trained to appreciate the Picturesque, these venerable landscapes still offered Wharton much inspiration regarding the fundamentals of landscape composition.</p><p><name type="pname">Both Platt</name> and <name type="pname">Wharton</name> understood that compartmentalized gardens&#x2014;and the opportunities for concealment, surprise, and spatial intimacy they offered&#x2014;constituted the essence of Italian garden design. At The Mount, her summer home on a knoll overlooking Laurel Lake in Lenox, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, Wharton set about designing a <name type="place">New England</name> version of an Italian garden (fig. 11.19). Her niece, the landscape designer <name type="pname">Beatrix Farrand</name> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959">1959</date>), prepared plans for the entrance drive and kitchen garden. Drawing on her intimate knowledge of Italian gardens but wishing to establish an American version appropriate to the topography and traditions of <name type="place">New England</name>, Wharton laid out a series of grassy terraces bordered with hemlock hedges, which she linked axially to the house. She connected these to a long cross axis, a 300-foot-long (91.4-meter-long) walk bordered by linden trees with a <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden at either end, one of which was a large red flower garden with a dolphin fountain in the center and the other a sunken <hi rend="italic">giardino segreto</hi> built with the proceeds of Wharton's successful novel <hi rend="italic">The House of Mirth</hi> (<date when="1905">1905</date>).

This was what the Italian villa designers, who conceived of house and garden as integral parts of a single plan, had done. In Cornish, New Hampshire, the summer art colony of which Platt was a member, he developed on five properties, including his own, an American version of the Italian villa, in which he created axial alignments, descending terraced slopes, and garden spaces shaped by architectural greenery as outdoor living rooms.</p><p>Between <date when="1896">1896</date> and <date when="1901">1901</date>, at Faulkner Farm in Brookline, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, Platt designed a garden<pb n="388"/><pb n="388" type="orig"/>for <name type="pname">Charles Sprague</name> and <name type="pname">Mary Pratt Sprague</name> (fig. 11.20). The steep grade of the site was conducive to creating a gridded <hi rend="italic">bosco</hi> with a circular temple in the center on the hillside above the entry court and on axis with the principal entrance to the house. Below the house, Platt designed the spacious lawn as a transition between garden and forest, taking advantage of the slope to create a series of descending grass terraces overlooking the western range of hills. As Olmsted had done at Biltmore and Moraine Farm, Platt withheld this panoramic view from immediate sight by placing a screen of densely planted trees alongside the long entrance drive on both sides of the entry court. He had lamented the decay of many of the flower-filled <hi rend="italic">giardini segreti</hi> that had once vivified Italian gardens, and now at Faulkner Farm he laid out a large rectangular flower garden terminating at the far end in a horseshoe-shaped pergola and pavilion modeled, like those designed by Peto, on one of Cardinal Gambera's at Villa Lante (fig. 11.21).</p><figure xml:id="fig-474"><graphic url="CH11_021.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="italic">Top:</hi> 11.20.

Italian-inspired, enriched by Arts and Crafts plantsmanship, the relaxed, historically evocative style that Platt helped create adapted a borrowed idiom to the American scene. As the republican values of the generation of Downing and Olmsted were replaced by those of the Gilded Age, the Italianate style became an expression of the cultural status of the successful industrialists and financiers who saw themselves as the successors of the Italian princes of the Renaissance, the collectors of artworks commissioned by the Medicis. Now, in democratic <name type="place">America</name>, these latter-day Medicis had become builders of city palaces and country villas. Beaux-Arts training and <name type="place">Rome</name> prize fellowships at the American Academy continued to be the primary path of career preparation for architects and landscape architects in the United States until World War II. For this reason one finds both in the planning of public parks and in the gardens of private estates a long-lingering debt to the principles of this style of neoclassical design.</p></div></div><div type="section"><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">II. The Edwardian and Post-Edwardian English Garden: Aristocracy's Golden Afternoon and Twilight</hi></hi></head><p>The incomprehensibility of vast social change as the entire religious and cultural underpinnings of a once-stable society is swept away by great tidal forces in the history of human affairs and the life of the human mind is the subject of Matthew Arnold's great, sad poem "Dover Beach" (<date when="1867">1867</date>). Its intimation of Western civilization's confusion and disarray was hardly heeded by Arnold's countrymen, the prosperous British aristocrats and industrialists who felt secure in the glory of their nation's empire over which a never-setting sun still shone.</p><p>But the Faustian power unleashed by the Industrial Revolution, the source of much economic prosperity, was demoniacally driving the science of war toward new and hideous ends of destruction while also propelling the great social transformations foreseen by Karl Marx. Nevertheless, from the perspective of those living at the turn of the twentieth century, the tragic upheaval of World War I and the Russian Revolution still lay a few years in the future, and even as these came to pass there were those whose fortunes survived. Before turning in Chapter Twelve to examine the landscapes of a visionary modernity as Western societies became more broadly democratic in the wake of their social transformations, we will examine a few more of the estate gar<pb n="389"/><pb n="389" type="orig"/>dens of this lingering aristocracy. Reduced in scale as new taxes eroded many old fortunes and rising labor costs curtailed maintenance budgets, these early-twentieth-century landscapes were still gracious if no longer grand.</p><p>World War I brought the era of country-house building to a halt in <name type="place">England</name> and ended what has been called the Edwardian Golden Afternoon&#x2014;a time when a privileged segment of society enjoyed garden teas, lawn tennis, and touring quiet country roads by bicycle and another new machine of the Industrial Age, the motor car. Still, Lutyens and Jekyll continued to collaborate. Now, however, when the two old friends worked together, it was on plans for soldiers' cemeteries, as the Imperial War Graves Commission had appointed Lutyens, along with Blomfield, principal architect for the ones in <name type="place">France</name>. But the domestic garden design idiom Jekyll and Lutyens had earlier forged was one that would serve well the postwar generation of estate owners, whose smaller properties and budgets did not allow the large-scale efforts of prior periods. The Arts and Crafts tradition pioneered by Robinson and the Jekyll-Lutyens partnership as it was fused with the Beaux-Arts style and the influence of Italian gardens found many notable expressions in the first half of the twentieth century. The style extends to the present day, and many of its finest practitioners were and are women. In part this was because the association of landscape architecture with the domestic realm made it seem more socially acceptable than female employment in some other professions.</p><p>With the writings of <name type="pname">Robinson</name>, <name type="pname">Jekyll</name>, and <name type="pname">Blomfield</name> and the lessons of Italian villa garden designers thoroughly assimilated and harmonized, the character of the early-twentieth-century English garden was now an agreeable stylistic amalgam of influences in which abundant, painterly herbaceous borders were happily incorporated into plans disciplined by architectonic principles. With unbounded prospect no longer necessarily possible or desirable as privacy and enclosure became design objectives once more, the eighteenth century's premium on unbroken openness was thoroughly invalidated. Although some naturalistic planting was found useful in blending the edges of the garden with the larger landscape beyond, Capability Brown, who had served before as a target of criticism for those advocating a different landscape style, came in for censure once again. It was a backward-looking time in which innovation lay in cherishing the British medieval and Tudor past and harmonizing this native heritage in an aesthetically agreeable manner with elements borrowed from the historic period styles of other countries.</p><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">Early Twentieth-Century English Garden Design</hi></hi></head><p>In his influential book <hi rend="italic">The Art and Craft of Garden Making</hi> (<date when="1900">1900</date>), <name type="pname">Thomas Hayton Mawson</name> (<date when="1861">1861</date>&#x2014; <date when="1933">1933</date>) professed the notion of landscape design as a careful selection from a menu of styles. Mawson, the first Englishman to style himself a "landscape architect," championed the "idealists," that is "old garden designers [who created] many stately avenues, grand parterres, quiet alleys, shady walks, sparking fountains, quaint hedges, architectural ponds and broad unbroken lawns, which in many cases are wedded together in such a masterly way, as to impress the spectator with the grandeur and transparent honesty of the whole scheme."<ref target="#CH11-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref>Brown, on the other hand, was chief among the "realists," who tried to imitate nature but came to rely on serpentine lines to the point where "undulation became a stock accomplishment." Mawson admired Repton, however&#x2014;not the earlier Picturesque landscape gardener, but rather the later advocate of the "Gardenesque."</p><p>Mawson promoted a return to the "truthful simplicity" of old gardens. He acknowledged, however, that "naturalism has, under certain conditions, its legitimate use and place in the creation of garden and park effects; and that a compromise between these two opposites or a combination of the two is at times the only method by which we can obtain anything like an effective whole."<ref target="#CH11-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref>Mawson's illustrations were more eclectic than Italianate. His style can best be summarized as a combination of Arts and Crafts flowers and topiary, Beaux-Arts unification of house and garden through axial planning, and the merging of these two influences with the curvilinear "naturalesque," as he called the informal style of garden design (fig. 11.22).</p><figure xml:id="fig-476"><graphic url="CH11_023.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.22.

At Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire, her home after <date when="1895">1895</date>, she created a series of garden compartments divided by stone walls and yew hedges. There was a Hornbeam Alley, a Persian Garden, and a Long Garden filled with topiary. Lindsay, who valued serendipity, admitted into her gardens a good deal of volunteer vegetation&#x2014;attractive weeds&#x2014;because they added an element of charming surprise (fig. 11.23). In the tradition of Robinson and Jekyll, she also created a wild garden, and, like Jekyll, served as a garden consultant to friends. She belongs to a special class of gardener whose passionate attachment to a particular place and to garden art amounts to a source of ecstasy. Writing in <hi rend="italic">Country Life</hi> in <date when="1931">1931</date>, Lindsay rhapsodized about Sutton Courtenay's "old sun-burnt walls. . . wreathed in wistaria tassels; the moonlit evenings when the turf is dry and warm, covered in rose petals like strange exotic shells; and the scent of syringa and honeysuckle weaves invisible webs of sweetness across one's dreaming face."<ref target="#CH11-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref></p><p>Although the garden at Sutton Courtenay did not survive, Lindsay's advice left an imprint on several extant gardens, including the deeply imaginative garden by <name type="pname">Lawrence Johnston</name> (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x2013;<date when="1958">1958</date>) at Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire.

With the instincts of a <name type="pname">Le Nôtre</name> for optical perspective and proportional geometries, he used farm machinery to grade the land, manipulating the topography to achieve different ground levels and to play tricks of foreshortening by creating barely perceptible slopes, as in the case of the grassy walk through the Red Borders to the twin pavilions guarding the entrance to the Stilt Garden (fig. 11.25). Spatial definition is one of the chief assets of Hidcote, and the pleasurable scale of the garden is enhanced by the way in which Johnston formed "walls" with hedges of yew, holly, box, and beech, interweaving them to provide different textures and shades of green.</p><p>The architectural lines of the garden form a foil for the perennial plants, which <name type="pname">Johnston</name>, benefiting from Norah Lindsay's counsel, arranged in unusual and effective combinations, allowing his garden some of the same careless luxuriance and surprising juxtapositions as hers.

At the same time, practitioners in this vein are extremely sophisticated, combining in original and often stunning ways newer hybrids with simple native varieties and plants with venerable horticultural histories, such as old-fashioned roses. In spite of this stylistic continuity lasting to the present day, Sissinghurst, created on the eve of World War II, symbolizes the end of an era. The postwar social agenda in <name type="place">England</name> and the rest of Europe, as well as the high taxes that support it, made the lavish private gardens built by the Edwardians and their Victorian predecessors impossible to sustain.

A large orangery off the east wing provides an effective transition between the house and the first of a series of outdoor rooms, the Beech Terrace, named for its central feature, a massive purple beech tree. As one descends to the Urn Terrace and, below it, to the <name type="pname">Rose Terrace</name>, then drops yet another level to the Fountain Terrace, one appreciates Farrand's eye for proportion, line, and detail (figs. 11.30,11.31,11.32). Her artistry appears in the scale of stairs and their finial and urn-punctuated piers, the deft interplay between straight and curving elements, and the contrasting textures of the carefully articulated ground plane with its finely crafted paving materials, grass, and planting beds (fig. 11.33). Below the Fountain Terrace, hidden from view, is one of Farrand's most charming conceits, a small outdoor amphitheater and Lover's Lane Pool.</hi></q><q><hi rend="bold">The elegant simplicity and restraint inherent in Farrand's work, as well as her ability to amalgamate her European and Arts and Crafts sources into an original design, is also apparent as one follows the garden's gently spiraling plan through the orchard and herbaceous border, enters the Box Walk leading to the Ellipse, then returns on this straight path past the Tennis Court and Swimming Pool to the North Court. Here her skill in orchestrating garden space is seen once more in the series of grassy terraces leading to an overlook revealing the wild natural scenery of Rock Creek below (fig. 11.34). Now a public park, this section was planted by Farrand to enhance its character as a nature preserve. Steps, paths, benches, and a stone bridge facilitated and poeticized excursions into this section of the garden.</hi></q><figure xml:id="fig-486"><graphic url="CH11_033.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.32.

In this, she translated the inspiration she derived from Italian, Chinese, and other landscape traditions into an elegant and original style, which is exemplified in her two finest surviving gardens. Dumbarton Oaks in <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="place">D.C.</name>, the estate of Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss, her masterpiece, demonstrates her confident originality in synthesizing the Arts and Crafts and Italianate landscape idioms of her time (figs. 11.29&#x2013;11.34).</p><p>The Eyrie Garden, designed for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, at Seal Harbor, Maine, has a large rectangular sunken garden, the walls of which are topped with imported Chinese tiles. This garden is entered on the north through a moon gate modeled on one Mrs. Rockefeller had admired in Beijing (fig. 11.35). Inside, Farrand planted annuals to maximize floral display during the short Maine summer, and surrounding the garden on the outside she created beds of perennials in a palette composed predominantly of lavender, blue, and white.</p><p>For Abby Rockefeller's husband, <name type="pname">John D. Rockefeller</name>, Jr., Farrand became a valued pro bono consultant on the planting plans for the carriage roads that Rockefeller conceived and funded at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine. Here, near her own summer home, at the dawn of the age of the automobile, she applied the principles learned from Olmsted's design of the drives at Biltmore and the Arnold Arboretum to enhance with native material&#x2014;spruce, pitch pine, sweet fern, wild roses, sumac, goldenrod, and bush blueberry&#x2014;Rockefeller's vision of scenic revelation through an artful arrangement of the motorist's serial vantage points.</p><figure xml:id="fig-489"><graphic url="CH11_036.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.35.

The founding of the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture for Women in <date when="1901">1901</date> in Groton, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women in <date when="1910">1910</date>, and the <name type="place">Cambridge</name> School of Landscape Architecture for Women in <date when="1916">1916</date> helped open a career path to women wishing to enter the field. Like Beatrice Farrand, Ellen Biddle Shipman (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1950">1950</date>), who received her training in the office of Charles Platt, ran an all-woman landscape architectural firm. As in the case of Farrand, Shipman's entry into the field was facilitated by her horticultural knowledge and an ability to provide planting plans for Platt and other landscape designers such as Warren Manning. Because she did not travel to Europe until <date when="1929">1929</date>, when she was sixty years old, her independent work was less influenced by foreign examples than that of Farrand or the <name type="place">Rome</name> prizewinners, who were her contemporaries. It can best be characterized as an application of Jekyll's lessons to a traditional Colonial-revival style&#x2014;a marriage of Arts and Crafts planting principles with the geometrical layout of old-fashioned American gardens&#x2014;or, put another way, a translation of formal design into a more relaxed, domestic vernacular. It was a style that was both sophisticated and unpretentious.</p><p>Shipman and her husband, Louis, were part of the artists' colony in Cornish, New Hampshire, which included <name type="pname">Charles Platt</name>. Although she had learned basic drafting skills in Platt's office, she lacked Farrand's rigorous professional training, including the requisite engineering skills to develop extensive grading and drainage plans. Nevertheless, in <date when="1920">1920</date>, she opened an office in <name type="place">New York</name> City. Because her work was almost exclusively residential, she did not seek membership in the recently formed, male-dominated American Society of Landscape Architects. Nevertheless, she found a substantial niche within the profession. The young Garden Club of America&#x2014;a national organization supporting the work of many local garden clubs throughout the country&#x2014;had stimulated an interest in horticulture among affluent women. They provided Shipman with a natural client base and network of referrals for commissions&#x2014;more than six hundred during her years of professional practice. Many of her jobs were undertaken in collaboration with other landscape architects, including Charles Platt, Warren Manning, and Fletcher Steele.</p><p>Able landscape photographers such as Mattie Edwards Hewitt recorded the appearance of many of Shipman's gardens (fig. 11.36). Publication of photographs of Shipman gardens in contemporary periodicals&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">The Garden, House and Garden,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">House Beautiful</hi>&#x2014;together with her skills as a public lecturer and her congenial personality, contributed to her success. Her clients tended to favor an atmosphere of<pb n="397"/><pb n="397" type="orig"/>idyllic seclusion and well-guarded privacy. As a rule, Shipman screened the borders of her gardens with heavy plantings. Her "secret" gardens were spaces for dreamy contemplation as well as for inticreated a conservative reaction mate socializing with family and friends. Smallscale works of sculpture inject notes of fancy and function as pleasing garden decor. Their meaning is secondary, for by the twentieth century mythology no longer had allegorical significance for designer or client but served as a branch of storytelling, providing a genteel foretaste of the role of fantasy in the thematic landscapes of the present day.</p><p>Shipman's planting schemes were typically accompanied by detailed horticultural instructions intended to ensure proper maintenance by clients and their gardeners. In addition, she made regular visits to estates where her designs were installed, and some clients put her in charge of administering annual discretionary funds for plant purchases. Her practice was far-flung, and she spent a great deal of time traveling by train and later by plane to job sites all over the United States. The Sarah P. Duke Memorial Gardens at Duke University in North Carolina was one of her most significant designs. Because she socialized with her clients, who introduced her to their friends, many of whom also hired her, she had clusters of commissions in such places as <name type="place">Cleveland</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>; Grosse Point, Michigan; the North Shore of Long Island; and Mount Kisco, <name type="place">New York</name>. In these pockets of affluence, until the exigencies of World War II brought commissions to a virtual halt, Shipman designed idyllic gardens, historically inflected refuges from the modern industrial scene&#x2014;ironically, the source of wealth that enabled many of the gardens to exist in the first place.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="bold">Eclecticism and the Invention of a Historic Past in <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place">Florida</name></hi></hi></head><p><name type="place">California</name> proved an ideal place for experimentation and the transformation of older forms of landscape design into a distinctive, if eclectic, regional style. Because the state enjoys some spectacular hilly and mountainous scenery and has along its coast what is known as a Mediterranean climate, it was especially congenial to the creation of Italianate and Spanish-style gardens. Although the Anglo-American railroad barons and other capitalists who first settled the state created gardens within the prevailing nineteenth-century Picturesque tradition, they soon began to capture the opportunities inherent in the mild climate, which, combined with irrigation technology, permitted the introduction of species of eucalyptus and other semitropical plants from <name type="place">Australia</name> and South Africa. Nurserymen in <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Barbara, and the <name type="place">Los Angeles</name> area realized the profitability of stocking exotic vegetation as well as the many kinds of fruit trees that thrived in this sun-drenched land. Palm trees propagated from imported stock contributed to <name type="place">California</name>'s growing palette of Mediterranean plants, which, given water, grew as lushly as those on the Riviera. Cacti and other plants from arid parts of the United States and Mexico found a natural home in the Desert Garden, begun in <date when="1905">1905</date> at the Huntington Gardens at San Marino, <name type="place">California</name>'s foremost assemblage of exotic plants. There, Henry Huntington's head gardener, William Hertrich, installed a number of botanical collections through massive transplanting and propagation in the estate's nurseries (fig. 11.37).</p><figure xml:id="fig-490"><graphic url="CH11_037.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.36.

Remoteness and a frontier spirit also served to foster a lifestyle less circumscribed by social convention than that of the Eastern seaboard. Helen Hunt Jackson's popular novel <hi rend="italic">Ramona</hi> (<date when="1884">1884</date>), written to call attention to federal policy injustices toward Native Americans and Hispanics, drew a romantic portrait of <name type="place">California</name>'s pre-Anglo way of life with its Franciscan missions and Spanish haciendas. This stimulated some highly imaginative reconstructions of actual missions and their gardens and gave birth to the Mission Revival style and other design interpretations of a mythical regional past, notably the somewhat later Spanish Colonial style. In this attempt to forge a regional identity and to project an architecture compatible with the newly enriched vegetal repertory, designers appropriated various Mediterranean styles, with principal emphasis on that of Andalusian Spain. In urban design terms, this is best seen in Santa Barbara where, after the earthquake of <date when="1925">1925</date>, the city set about rebuilding itself almost entirely in terms of a remarkably inventive pseudo-Spanish style, best illustrated by its grandly scaled centerpiece, architect William Mooser's courthouse. Unlike a traditionally inward-focused Spanish building, the Santa Barbara Courthouse has a colossal entry arch that frames a view of the beautiful mountainous landscape in which the city sits.<ref target="#CH11-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref></p><figure xml:id="fig-492"><graphic url="CH11_039.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.38.

In the first decade of the twentieth century, Japanese influence combined with that of the prevailing Arts and Crafts movement to produce the sensitive siting, fine hand detailing, and imaginative use of natural materials by Charles Sumner Greene (<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>) and <name type="pname">Henry Mather Greene</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1954">1954</date>), architects in Pasadena. In <date when="1921">1921</date>, Charles Greene demonstrated in the <name type="pname">David L. James</name> house in the Carmel Highlands his complete mastery of an original design vocabulary in which local rock walls, the result of meticulous, painstaking craftsmanship, appear to emerge organically from the geological structure of the hillside. In <date when="1911">1911</date> and <date when="1926">1926</date>&#x2013;28, he performed an equal but different tour de force at Green Gables, the Mortimer and Bella Fleishacker estate overlooking the Santa Cruz Mountains in Woodside. In the monumental staircase and arcade of the beautiful water garden, Greene executed his Beaux-Arts design in a rustic, regional manner using uncut native stones (fig. 11.38).</p><p>Not all wealthy Californians pursued the path of stylistic experimentation opened up by these original designers. One of the most renowned of the remaining gardens from this period is Filoli, nestled into the exceptionally scenic landscape of Woodside, 30 miles south of <name type="place">San Francisco</name>. The Georgian-style house, designed by <name type="pname">Willis Polk</name> (<date when="1870">1870</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924">1924</date>) of <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, was built between <date when="1916">1916</date> and <date when="1919">1919</date> for William Bowers Bourn II, owner of a hard-rock gold mine and a local water company, after Bourn purchased his 654acre estate. Bourn's friend and hunting companion Bruce Porter (<date when="1865">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1955">1955</date>), a poet, painter, and artist in stained glass as well as a landscape designer, was responsible for the layout of the garden, and Isabella Worn, a <name type="place">San Francisco</name> floral designer, for the planting plans. Her work continued after new owners purchased the property in <date when="1936">1936</date>. Neither Porter nor Worn had a talent approaching Farrand's, but, aided by the spectacular site, excellent climate, and good current management by the Filoli Center, their work resulted in a garden of considerable charm (fig. 11.39).</p><p>Sometimes the <name type="place">California</name> Mediterranean expression was carried to theatrical heights, as at San Simeon, the estate of William Randolph Hearst. An amalgam of stage-set effects, San Simeon evokes<pb n="399"/><pb n="399" type="orig"/>styles as diverse as those of ancient <name type="place">Egypt</name> and contemporary Art Moderne. <name type="pname">Julia Morgan</name> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1957">1957</date>), the first woman to be enrolled in the architecture program of the &#x00C9;cole des Beaux-Arts and the first to obtain a license from the State of <name type="place">California</name> to practice architecture, designed the palatial house and exotic guest houses. Charles Gibbs Adams was the landscape architect who responded to Hearst's grandiose ideas as the gardens took shape around the vast collections of exotic animals, specimen trees, sculpture, and decorative artifacts that Hearst amassed at this private fantasy weekend "resort."</p><p>Although eastern architects such as Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (<date when="1869">1869</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924">1924</date>) joined the handful of resident professionals who received commissions to design houses and gardens on <name type="place">California</name> estates in the <date when="1920">1920</date>s, amateurs and nurserymen were responsible for laying out some of the most notable ones. Goodhue was the architect in charge of the <date when="1915">1915</date> Panama-<name type="place">California</name> Exposition held in San Diego. In opposition to Irving Gill and others who saw this as an opportunity to forge a simpler, more modern regional idiom, Goodhue deemed a neo-traditional Spanish Colonial Baroque style to be the most desirable one for the fair's buildings. The landscape designers matched its architectural flamboyance with a riot of lush semitropical vegetation arranged in extravagant floral displays. The fair gave license to an unbridled eclecticism, and the opulent tone it set was highly influential. Not only did various forms of Spanish and Mexican architecture become popular, but direct imitation of Italian villa architecture and gardens was widely practiced.</p><p>A nurseryman, <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name>, was inspired by the fair to seek his living as a designer of great estates. With entrepreneurial energy and a flair for salesmanship, Hanson became a landscape contractor, hiring the design and horticultural talent he needed to fulfill his commissions. In his breezy memoir, he tells how he succeeded in getting the job to design Greenacres, movie millionaire Harold Lloyd's 16-acre estate in Beverly Hills. Working with golf course designer Billy Bell and architect Sumner Spaulding, he created between <date when="1925">1925</date> and <date when="1929">1929</date> a grandiose scheme that included a 100-foot (30.5-meter) waterfall spilling into a canoe course that also served as a water hazard for the golf course, a fairy-tale English village play yard with a thatched roof cottage and pony stable for Lloyd's three-year-old daughter, a "Villa Lante" cascade, a "Villa Medici" fountain, and a "Villa d'Este" pool. The house was modeled on the Villa Gamberaia (fig. 11.40).</p><p><name type="pname">Architect George</name> <name type="place">Washington</name> <name type="pname">Smith</name> (<date when="1876">1876</date>&#x2014; <date when="1930">1930</date>), was instrumental in forging the Santa Barbara style of Neo-Spanish Colonial domestic architecture shaded patios with tiled fountain basins, also employed the villas of <name type="place">Italy</name> as models. Casa del Herrero (House of the Blacksmith), the 11-acre estate that <name type="place">Washington</name> designed for George Fox Steedman in <date when="1922">1922</date>&#x2013;25, is perhaps the architect's masterpiece. Here he worked first with landscape architect Ralph Stevens and then with Lockwood deForest (<date when="1896">1896</date>&#x2013;<date when="1949">1949</date>) to create by <date when="1933">1933</date> a series of axially related garden spaces with tiled water channels and low, Spanish-style fountains (fig. 11.41).</p><figure xml:id="fig-494"><graphic url="CH11_041.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.40.

Florence Yoch (<date when="1890">1890</date>&#x2013;<date when="1972">1972</date>), assisted by her partner, Lucille Council, designed gardens specifically for movie sets, including the one for <hi rend="italic">Gone With the Wind.</hi> In the <date when="1930">1930</date>s,<pb n="400"/><pb n="400" type="orig"/>Yoch was hired to create gardens for such Hollywood executives as director George Cukor and producer <name type="pname">Jack Warner</name>.

But, like Hanson, Yoch found in Montecito the conditions that inspired what is perhaps her finest creation, Il Brolino, the fey topiary garden she designed on the 7-acre estate of lumber heiress Mary Stewart to complement George <name type="place">Washington</name> Smith's handsome Italian-villa-style house (fig. 11.42). Here one sees the flexibility of her imagination in the way she softened the garden's geometrical lines with the fat, rounded, whimsical forms of animals and playing-card symbols in clipped boxwood, artfully juxtaposed against the background trees and mountains beyond. This quality is also apparent in her habit of modifying symmetry with adjustments to site conditions and the occasional eccentric placement of a tree or other object within an otherwise formal space.</p><figure xml:id="fig-496"><graphic url="CH11_043.jpg"/><figDesc><hi rend="bold">11.42.

Some built great estates, employing design idioms similar to those used in <name type="place">California</name>. One of the most extravagantly spectacular Italianate gardens of the Gilded Age is Vizcaya, built between <date when="1912">1912</date> and <date when="1916">1916</date> on Biscayne Bay in <name type="place">Florida</name> by James Deering, heir of the harvesting machinery manufacturer. F. Burrall Hoffman, Jr., designed the house as a boldly eclectic pastiche, with each facade portraying a different era of Italian villa architecture. Hoffman's artistically inclined friend, Paul Chalfin, helped him garner the tapestries and furniture to create the grand decorative effects that lend the interior its air of opulence. Diego Suarez, a Colombian who was tutored in landscape design at La Pietra by Arthur Acton, created the elaborate gardens, which combine echoes of Spain, <name type="place">France</name>, and <name type="place">Venice</name>, and serve as a reminder of Isola Bella, the Borromeo family villa whose terraces rise like the decks of a galleon from the waters of Lake Maggiore (fig. 11.43; see figs. 5.40&#x2013;5.41).</p><p>Vizcaya was a bellwether, stimulating rich Easterners and eventually the European Riviera set to come to <name type="place">Florida</name>. Promoted by the entrepreneur Henry Flagler, Palm Beach became a fashionable resort in large measure due to Addison Mizner (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x2013;<date when="1933">1933</date>). Mizner was a society architect practicing first in Phil<pb n="401"/><pb n="401" type="orig"/>adelphia and then in <name type="place">New York</name>. His career was given a tremendous boost after <date when="1918">1918</date> when he discovered Palm Beach and its potential as an American Riviera. With some of the same eclectic imagination and flair for client relations as <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name>, Mizner, who was widely traveled and a collector of antiques and architectural artifacts from all over the world, invented virtually single-handedly the Palm Beach style, a pseudo-Hispanic amalgam of dramatic decorative effects. Mizner took complete charge of his clients' projects, serving as architect, interior decorator, and landscape designer.</p><p>Though physically distant, as resort communities with a similar ethos of self-invented domestic and urbanistic stagecraft and a common Hispanic-Italianate-Mediterranean appearance, Santa Barbara and Palm Beach were close cousins. Mizner, in fact, took the skills he perfected in <name type="place">Florida</name> to <name type="pname">Parklane</name>, an estate in Santa Barbara where he combined Venetian Gothic elements with images derived from the Villa Lante. Thus did wealthy Americans of this period commission designers to take recipes from the European banquet and concoct architectural menus of cribbed grandeur intended to surpass the original models. Sometimes blatantly, as in the gardens of <name type="pname">A. E. Hanson</name> and elsewhere more subtly, as in the gardens of Platt, Farrand, and Shipman, we find evidence of the transformation of garden art into garden style.</p><p>Resort communities such as <name type="pname">Santa Barbara</name> and Palm Beach are phenomena of machine-age technology&#x2014;beautiful and remote places made accessible by private railroad car (later by private jet). The cost of transportation for their temporary residents, among other factors, ensured their status as exclusive enclaves, especially in their early years. Commercial rail and aviation and, more significant, mass production of the twentieth-century machine par excellence, the private automobile, has democratized the landscape, making many beautiful places accessible to the masses.
