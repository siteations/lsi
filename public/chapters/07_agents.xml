Both poetry and the development of landscape painting as a specific genre stimulated and influenced a growing taste for rural scenery and landscape designs that reflected the mind's sensations and moods.</p><p>With the couplet that serves as his memorable epitaph&#x2014;"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night, God said, 'let <name type="pname" key="7000">Newton</name> be,' and all was light"&#x2014;poet, essayist, and garden enthusiast <name type="pname" key="7001">Alexander Pope</name> (<date when="1688">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1744">1744</date>) epitomized the place in history of the great English physicist and mathematician <name type="pname" key="7000">Sir Isaac Newton</name> (<date when="1642">1642</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727">1727</date>). With the discovery of the optical properties of light, definition of the laws of motion, development of an infinitesimal calculus, and formulation of the law of universal gravitation, <name type="pname" key="7000">Newton</name> effectively laid the foundations of modern science. What followed was an unprecedented confidence in human reason. <name type="pname" key="7000">Newton</name> fathered the Enlightenment and was a correspondent and later president of the <name type="pname" key="7225" subtype="corp">Royal Society</name>, which promoted open-ended scientific discovery in an era when the universities still taught according to an Aristotelian pedagogy that presupposed the systematization of scholarship within an all-encompassing, self-contained framework.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7000">Newton</name>'s contemporary <name type="pname" key="7002">John Locke</name> (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704">1704</date>) was a philosopher whose vision of epistemology, politics, education, and medicine helped lay the groundwork for a new human psychology as well as for a new empirical approach to science. Taking issue with <name type="pname" key="7226">Descartes</name>'s belief in the mind as a repository of innate ideas, he declared that, to the contrary, all knowledge of the world must rest on sensory experience. This concept of the mind as an instrument for inductive reasoning and a theater for personal experience, rather than as a receptacle for revealed Truth and immutable law, had an important effect on garden design in the eighteenth century as landscapes were contrived to furnish the sensate mind with specific mental associations and impressions.</p><p>As a physical manifestation of the intellectual philosophy laid out in <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</hi></title> (<date when="1690">1690</date>), and the consequent authority granted to individual sensibility, the garden assumed a new character and function. Its role as a place of authoritarian power, display, and social entertainment was diminished as it became a place of meditation, reflection, and friendship. <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name> provides the key to understanding the emphasis upon the associative potential of garden scenes in the eighteenth century. As the intellectual tradition of Neoplatonic classicism waned and landscape design based upon the notion of an underlying normative order of harmonic proportion ceased to be influential, the desire to produce stimuli for a wide range of mental experiences and emotions fostered a new kind of garden making. Its orientation toward sensibility, rather than abstract beauty, caused patrons and designers to value ancient architectural styles, ruins, commemorative monuments, and a richly varied natural scenery. These provoked admiration and reflection, induced moral instruction, and created pleasurable surprise.</p><p>The intellectual freedom engendered by <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>'s fresh examination of the workings of the human mind fostered and supported the contemporary climate of political change. <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name> was taken into the household of <name type="pname" key="7003">Baron Ashley</name> (later the first earl of Shaftesbury) as a physician. He proved to be an influential confidant of that statesman as well, working toward the goals of increased civil liberty, constitutional monarchy, parliamentary rule, religious toleration, Protestant succession, and mercantile trade. Thus, although the actual gardens of his own day were the<pb n="233"/><pb n="233" type="orig"/>French-inspired ones of the Restoration and the Anglo-Dutch gardens of <name type="pname" key="7005">William and Mary</name>, <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>'s belief in political freedom, together with his seminal ideas on sensory awareness, provided the intellectual soil for the gardens of Georgian England. The result was a more naturalistic style, with architectural and ornamental elements used as images to stimulate ideas of a historical, ethical, partisan, or sentimental nature, thus promoting the proud ideal of the country itself as a kind of libertarian garden.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7006">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</name> (<date when="1712">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">1778</date>), in his philosophical and political discourses on the importance of reverie and the power of the imagination, extended <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>'s influence. The mind as a self-aware organ, capable of feats of intuition as well as reason, could produce visions of a more perfect human society. Inspired by images of ancient <name type="place">Sparta</name> and republican <name type="place">Rome</name> as well as of his native city of <name type="place">Geneva</name>, he set forth in <title><hi rend="italic">The Social Contract</hi></title> (<date when="1762">1762</date>) a doctrine of human equality and political democracy.</p><p>Believing in the innate goodness of "natural man" and in the inspirational character of nature, <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name> became a prophet not only for the political revolutionaries who read in him their own social visions, but also of Romanticism. This movement, which gained force at the end of the eighteenth century and extends into our own day, posed a spiritual counterbalance to the scientific rationalism of the Enlightenment. Emotion and visionary intuition as a mode of human perception became as important as thought and rational calculation. <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name>'s philosophy, which enlarged the freedom <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name> had granted the senses, was instrumental in reinvesting classicism with poetic visions of a lost Golden Age. It is understandable, therefore, that the eighteenth-century garden&#x2014;a place particularly congenial to reverie, recollection, reflection, and imaginative participation in an ideal world beyond "corrupt" civilization&#x2014;owed a debt to his theories. Appropriately, it was in the romantically conceived garden of the <name type="pname" key="7007">Marquis de Girardin</name> at <name type="place" subtype="site">Ermenonville</name> that <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name> sought refuge at the end of his life.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name> was the intellectual heir not only to <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>, but also to <name type="pname" key="7004">Anthony Ashley Cooper</name>, third earl of Shaftesbury (<date when="1671">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1713">1713</date>), an Enlightenment writer who, like <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name>, believed in the innate goodness of natural man and of nature. <name type="pname" key="7004">Shaftesbury</name> saw landscapes as having personality; he cried out to the "Genius of the Place,"<ref target="#CH7-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> the spirit that interacts with the human mind, eliciting emotions, fostering perceptions, stimulating both memory and curiosity. <name type="pname" key="7004">Shaftesbury</name> advocated grottoes, cascades, and other dramatically charged landscape forms as a means of stimulating mental associations with nature's mysteries. His thoughts influenced <name type="pname" key="7018">Addison</name> and <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>, writers whose garden theories were influential at the time when a series of emblematically significant English gardens&#x2014;including most notably <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> and <name type="place" subtype="site">Castle Howard</name>&#x2014;were being created.</p><p>As the associative potential of gardens to thematically portray a particular ideology became less compelling and the enclosure movement gathered force, English landscape design tradition evolved into the abstractly expressive style of <name type="pname" key="7008">"Capability" Brown</name> and, subsequently, into the Picturesque style with its Rococo inflection, which proved especially popular in <name type="place">France</name>, where the style's variant of the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> was termed the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi>. The Picturesque theorists who set themselves in opposition to <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> engendered a great deal of spirited debate because the eighteenth-century garden remained an arena of aesthetic idealism even after it had become less didactically explicit. The relationship between landscape and political and intellectual philosophy was important not only in <name type="place">Europe</name> but also in the newly formed <name type="place">United States of America</name> where <name type="pname" key="7009">Thomas Jefferson</name> imaginatively took up the task of garden design while also shaping a vision for an agrarian nation of continental dimensions.</p><p>Perhaps the most important eighteenth-century minds besides <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name>'s to further the trend toward Romanticism in the West and to anticipate the coming age's commitment to industrial capitalism and democracy were those of the German polymath and poet <name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name> and the seminal English poet <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>. Although both had practical experience in garden design, their influence was more broadly cultural. <name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name> saw nature as a source of experiential ecstasy that could, if carried to excess as was the tendency of his time, be debilitating as well as exhilarating. In <title><hi rend="italic">Faust Part II</hi></title> he also anticipated the dark Romanticism implicit in <name type="pname" key="7227">Nietzsche</name>'s notion of a Superman. By portraying his famous protagonist in the guise of industrial developer&#x2014;Faust's ultimate quest for experience and ascendance over nature and the rest of humankind&#x2014;<name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name> foresaw the exponential release of new sources of energy and capitalist power that would occur as the Industrial Revolution gained momentum. <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s poems also encouraged intense and intimate communion with and reflection upon nature. For <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>, love of nature was inevitably conjoined with reverence for the human mind, the noble instrument of Lockean perception, without which nature's marvelous beauty would be as naught. In addition, <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> fostered empathy for common humanity, finding simple, honest beauty in the quotidian experience of ordinary lives. Thus, <name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name> and <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> are pivotal, carrying forward into the nineteenth century the strikingly important eighteenth-century concept that "the genius of the place" and human genius, a gift to all mortals, are inextricably allied.</p><pb n="234"/><pb n="234" type="orig"/><div type="section"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Genius of the Place: Forging a New Landscape Style through Literature, Art, and Theory</hi></hi></head><p>Many advocates of the naturalistic garden read into <name type="pname" key="7012">John Milton</name>'s description of Eden in <title><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi></title> a vision of a new style innocent of "nice Art / In Beds and curious Knots. &#x2026; / A happy rural seat of various view. &#x2026;"<ref target="#CH7-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> But <name type="pname" key="7001">Alexander Pope</name> was the poet most responsible for turning English garden design in a different direction. By his writing and example, <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name> actively publicized the style of landscape design favored by the Whig aristocracy and gentry as well as their literary and artistic friends. These Whig landowners, often with <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>'s advice, initiated projects that wed English taste for country houses in the architectural style of <name type="pname" key="7013">Andrea Palladio</name> with English scenery, creating landscapes that attempted to evoke "the genius of the place."</p><p>Their creation of a new landscape style was less radical, and more evolutionary, than subsequent chauvinistic generations would like to believe. <name type="pname" key="7014">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s follower <name type="pname" key="7015">Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville</name> (<date when="1680">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765">1765</date>) published in <date when="1712">1712</date> an English edition of his <date when="1709">1709</date> influential treatise <title><hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pratique du jardinage</hi></title> in which he proposed that art give way to nature. The variety and irregularity he advocated within his otherwise geometrical plans showed the gradual relaxation of <name type="pname" key="7160">Louis XIV</name>'s authoritarian style around the time of the king's death when a more liberal culture began to be reflected in all the arts. While envisioning a different end from that which <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name> had in mind when advising <name type="pname" key="7017">Lord Burlington</name> to "Consult the Genius of the Place in all," it was <name type="pname" key="7015">Dezallier</name>, not an Englishman, who first suggested the ha-ha, a continuous ditch that acted as a sunken fence permitting the visual unification of the garden and its surrounding countryside. But the naturalistic style soon became almost exclusively identified with <name type="place">England</name>. This was due substantially to the pains Whig aristocrats took to express belief felt in their country's civil liberties.</p><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Literary Proponents of a New Style</hi></hi></head><p><name type="pname" key="7018">Joseph Addison</name> (<date when="1672">1672</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719">1719</date>) in his essays in <title><hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi></title>_and <title><hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi></title> argued for a kind of landscape improvement that was anti-authoritarian and practical. He thought that "a Man might make a pretty Landskip of his own Possessions" merely by planting oaks on his hilltops, recognizing the beauty of his willow-filled marshes and fields of grain and improving these and his wildflower meadows by maintaining the paths between them. He scorned Dutch taste, deploring the fact that "Our Trees rise in Cones, Globes, and Pyramids &#x2026; [with] the Marks of the Scissars on every Plant and Bush."<ref target="#CH7-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref> The liberation of the English garden from artifice and constraint in the eighteenth century mirrored, in <name type="pname" key="7018">Addison</name>'s mind, the country's freedom from autocratic rule.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7018">Addison</name> recommended to his readers the gardens of <name type="place">China</name>, which "conceal the Art by which they direct themselves."<ref target="#CH7-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref> Chinese porcelains were beginning to appear in <name type="place">England</name> with the burgeoning of the export trade, and <name type="pname" key="7228">Matteo Ripa</name>'s engraved landscape views, reputedly the first illustrations of Chinese gardens to reach the West, were in the hands of <name type="pname" key="7017">Lord Burlington</name> after <date when="1724">1724</date>. <name type="pname" key="7018">Addison</name>'s recommendation of the apparent artlessness of Chinese gardens as a stimulant to the "Imagination" prodded landowners to new possibilities. Like the "fantastical phenomenon" discussed by <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name> in <title><hi rend="italic">Some Thoughts on the Conduct of the Understanding in the Search of Truth</hi></title> (<date when="1690">1690</date>), they provided images and, thereby, a variety of sensory impressions that induced in the mind a state of reverie.

His sympathy with classical subjects and appreciation of the relaxed relationship that existed between art and nature in Roman times had been nourished by a receptive reading of the ancient poets and statesmen. The agricultural self-sufficiency of Pliny's villas, their function as places of private retirement and social entertainment, their attention to human comfort and scenic prospect&#x2014;all these things inspired an agrarian emphasis in eighteenth-century English gardens. This, in turn, influenced the emblematic character of garden ornament as numerous statues of Ceres, Flora, and Bacchus took up residence in English fields alongside of those <pb n="235"/><pb n="235" type="orig"/>traditional garden deities, Pan and Venus. So compelling was the hold exerted by <name type="place">Rome</name> on the eighteenth-century English imagination that <name type="pname" key="7017">Richard Boyle</name>, third earl of Burlington (<date when="1695">1695</date>&#x2013;<date when="1753">1753</date>) financed <name type="pname" key="7019">Robert Castell</name>'s publication in <date when="1728">1728</date> of <title><hi rend="italic">Villas of the Ancients</hi></title>, a reconstruction in plan (somewhat mistakenly along symmetrical Palladian lines) of <name type="pname" key="7230">Pliny the Younger</name>'s two villas, <name type="place" subtyle="site">Tusci</name> and <name type="place" subtyle="site">Laurentinum</name>.</p><p>Because of this sympathy for the poets of the early Roman Empire, the first two decades of the eighteenth century in <name type="place">England</name> are sometimes called an Augustan Age. In keeping with his self-image as a latter-day Augustan at the moment in history when <name type="place">England</name> was on the verge of garnering an empire, the Whig lord's great house was frequently designed in the Palladian style. The simple dignity of this form of classical architecture and its relatively modest scale evoked more effectively the virtues of the antique world than did the more flamboyant and grandiose architecture of the contemporary Baroque style.</p><p>An amateur architect and the center of an influential artistic and literary coterie, <name type="pname" key="7017">Lord Burlington</name> created his villa at <name type="place" subtype="site">Chiswick</name> as a small-scale version of <name type="pname" key="7013">Palladio</name>'s <name type="place" subtype="site">Villa Rotonda</name> (fig. 7.1). The landscape he created there over a twenty-year period beginning in <date when="1725">1725</date> pioneered the marriage of a symmetrical Palladian house with an artfully irregular landscape that nevertheless preserved elements of Continental classical order. Within the garden were winding paths and long perspectival corridors of greenery framing obelisks and several small Palladian temples and pavilions.</p><p>Other Whig lords were also amateurs in the original sense of the word: lovers of literature and the arts and sciences. They were students of the classics, travelers abroad and connoisseurs of painting, sculpture, and architecture. In addition, they were active on behalf of liberal reform and jealous guardians of recently granted political freedoms (including the freedom to disagree overtly with their government). Owners of large tracts of newly enclosed rural land, they solicited and implemented the advice of their literary mentors. Their patronage of a new generation of designers transformed garden design from an art based on architectural geometry to one based to a large degree on techniques of painterly composition. Their gardens were no longer created with "rule and line," but rather as a painter would compose a subject on a canvas. In them, poetry and history were employed as resources for various thematic itineraries.</p><p>As we walk today through some of these now-historic English gardens, it is difficult to remember how filled with associative meaning they were to their first visitors. Indeed, even by the middle of the eighteenth century, as we shall see, general acquaintance with old mythologies and their imagery was disappearing and the emblematic character of landscape was being replaced by a less didactic approach to design, one that the garden historian <name type="pname" key="7020">John Dixon Hunt</name> calls "expressive." This type of garden relied less on such keys to understanding as <name type="pname" key="7021">Cesare Ripa</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Iconologia: or Moral Emblems</hi></title> and more completely on nature unadorned, but carefully arranged, for its expressive effect.<ref target="#CH7-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref></p><figure xml:id="fig-277"><graphic url="CH7_002.jpg"/><figDesc>7.1.

Addison led others in using it to imply the arrangement of landscape forms so that they resembled painting. The educated Whig aristocrats who spearheaded the evolution of a naturalistic idiom of gardening in the first decades of the eighteenth century did so in conscious imitation of the landscape paintings they collected. The French seventeenth-century painters <name type="pname" key="7024">Claude Lorrain</name> (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1682">1682</date>) and <name type="pname" key="7025">Nicolas Poussin</name> (<date when="1594">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665">1665</date>) were especially esteemed; <name type="pname" key="7024">Claude</name> in particular embodied for these lords the spirit of <name type="pname" key="7045">Virgil</name> and a vanished Golden Age, the aura of which they had experienced as travelers in the <name type="place">Roman Campagna</name> (fig. 7.2).</p><p>Like <name type="pname" key="7025">Poussin</name>, <name type="pname" key="7024">Claude</name> had lived and painted in <name type="place">Rome</name>. He painted figures in a half-wild bucolic landscape within which rose simple cubic peasant structures and imaginary temples based on ancient ruins. Mythological in subject matter, they exude the atmosphere of <name type="place">Arcadia</name> and are reminiscent of the poetry of <name type="pname" key="7045">Virgil</name>. Narrative association, as much as a new <pb n="236"/><pb n="236" type="orig"/>relationship between art and nature, would inspire the design of <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> and <name type="place" subtype="site">Stourhead</name>, <name type="place" subtype="site">Painshill</name> and <name type="place" subtype="site">Esher Place</name>. These gardens were arranged as theaters of meditation, a series of staged scenes where the human visitor was both spectator and actor. But unlike the theater, where pastoral dramas were enacted before the stationary spectator, here the viewer moved from scene to scene, and the scenes themselves were only allusive settings in which the dramatic action existed solely in the mind of each visitor.

Like other members of <name type="pname" key="7017">Lord Burlington</name>'s coterie, he admired Palladian architecture and was deeply committed to the classical traditions of ancient <name type="place">Rome</name>. Like <name type="pname" key="7018">Addison</name>, he scorned topiary and faulted symmetry because it produced monotony and lack of variety, well-ordered variety being perhaps the single most esteemed trait in <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>'s theory of design.</p><p>His own garden at <name type="place" subtype="site">Twickenham</name> was famed above all for its remarkable three-chambered grotto, the walls of which were studded with mineral specimens, shells, and mirrors to reflect and multiply the view, a place where <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name> could engage in reverie, literary pursuit, or conversation with his constant stream of visitors. This grotto was conceived as a dream chamber, a place both to soothe and stimulate the mind. While this eighteenth-century version of a classical <hi rend="italic">nymphaeum</hi>, with its artificial stalactites, imbedded minerals, and dripping water, was obviously the height of artifice, <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name> was proud to boast that he had "strictly followed Nature" in creating it. And, from his perspective, he was correct. He had eschewed the elaborately artificial hydraulics and arcane mythological decorative programs of Renaissance grottoes in favor of a more naturalistic cave in which he had arranged his geological specimens so as to simulate a quarry or mine. <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>'s grotto was, above all, a highly personal expression, containing associations with the many friends whom he had entertained there and reminding him through its numerous geologic specimens of the correspondents who had sent them to him.</p><p>Another popular and influential poet, <name type="pname" key="7028">James Thomson</name> (<date when="1700">1700</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748">1748</date>), saw the English garden as a metaphor for British freedoms. He is remembered for<pb n="237"/><pb n="237" type="orig"/>his long poem and life work <title><hi rend="italic">The Seasons</hi></title>, a paean to British landscape that anticipates Romanticism in its religious attitude toward nature. His reverential awe for nature's bounty and beauty was coupled with the growing pride the English felt in the loveliness of their countryside, particularly as the wave of landscape improvement swept the nation. For <name type="pname" key="7028">Thomson</name> the realm of imagination and the realm of landscape were intertwined. The mind itself was a kind of landscape: "the varied scene of quick-compounded thought," in which "visionary vales," "weeping grottoes," and "prophetic glooms" provoked reflection. It was "the mind's creative eye" that gave meaning to sensation.<ref target="#CH7-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref></p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Landscape Theorists and Practitioners</hi></hi></head><p>The philosophy that saw the mind as a theater of sensation and therefore landscape experience as a stimulus to reflection caused some landed Englishmen to think about their properties in a new way. Ordinary farmland could be ornamented with monuments that evoked sensations, heightening interest and stimulating emotion. A farm could therefore be both practical and poetic. The notion of the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi>, or farm-aslandscape, was first proposed in <name type="place">England</name> by the nurseryman and garden designer <name type="pname" key="7029">Stephen Switzer</name> (c. <date when="1682">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>).<ref target="#CH7-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> His influential volume <title><hi rend="italic">The Nobleman, Gentleman, and Gardener's Recreation</hi></title> of <date when="1715">1715</date> was expanded in <date when="1718">1718</date> into the three-volume <title><hi rend="italic">Iconographia Rustica</hi></title>. It was again augmented in a <date when="1742">1742</date> edition with progressive ideas derived from two decades of landscape design development. It is against the background of the enclosure movement that <name type="pname" key="7029">Switzer</name>'s popularity and that of later garden theorists and practitioners can be best understood.</p><p>Since the waning of the Middle Ages, as <name type="place">Britain</name>'s population swelled and sheep and cattle grazing became a dominant agrarian activity, ancient forestland and inhospitable heath had been converted to hedged fields and pastures, notably in the southern counties. Around certain ancient villages, where there were additional grassy downs for grazing, some of the open fields, which had formerly been held as commons and tilled by allotment, were enclosed by contract agreement. This process of enclosure accelerated in the eighteenth century when more than 3 million acres of arable land were enclosed by acts of Parliament and private treaty as the economic value of improved turf for grazing transformed British agriculture from a community-based system of open-field cultivation and common pasturage to one of private ownership.</p><p>Simultaneously, in response to <name type="place">England</name>'s timber famine in the seventeenth century, <name type="pname" key="7030">John Evelyn</name>'s influential book <title><hi rend="italic">Sylva</hi></title> had promoted a tree-planting program, and the reforestation of the countryside in order to increase the production of wood for fuel, shipbuilding, and other forms of construction was now fully under way. The enclosed lands, a combination of rectangular fields hedged with white hawthorn interspersed with ash and elm trees, were called parks. Where foxhunting was a sport, there were occasional copses between the fields. The increased control over water supplies by wealthy owners, who were able to impound it in ponds and pump it through pipes, made possible a far greater independence in the siting of houses than heretofore. This permitted a thorough consideration of the presentation of the residential seat and the views to be enjoyed from its windows. The vast amount of estate improvement attendant upon enclosure effectively transformed the English countryside into the landscape we know today. This tremendous beautification effort came at the price of a great deal of human suffering. Enclosure took pasturage rights away and forced the majority of rural people to become tenant farmers.</p><p>This is the context in which <name type="pname" key="7029">Switzer</name> enthusiastically claimed the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> to be derived from "some of the best Genius's of <name type="place">France</name>," as well as from <name type="place">Rome</name> where it had been proved "the truest and best Way of Gardening in the World, and such as the politest and best Genius of all Antiquity delighted in." These were encouraging words for literary and aesthetically inclined landowners who wanted to incorporate poetic and painterly sensation into their recently enclosed utilitarian landscapes. But <name type="pname" key="7029">Switzer</name> was, after all, a professional man dependent upon the favor of his clients. As many of these still owned the kind of gardens that had been laid out in the French classical tradition, he advanced his ideas more cautiously than did the literary advocates and their friends, the Whig landowners.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7031">Batty Langley</name> (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751">1751</date>) represents to an even greater degree than <name type="pname" key="7029">Switzer</name> the lingering influence of French classical tradition in <name type="place">England</name>. Arguing for variety and respect for natural landscape features in his <date when="1728">1728</date> <title><hi rend="italic">New Principles of Gardening</hi>, <name type="pname" key="7031">Langley</name> nevertheless gives formulaic prescriptions, and his illustrations consist of ornate labyrinthine paths that twirl and squiggle like elegant Rococo exercises within highly regular garden plots. Geometric basins in the French manner form the centerpieces of these curious mazes, and elsewhere in his "grand, beautiful and natural" gardens he advocates broad, straight avenues and geometrically shaped lawns. Like <name type="pname" key="7029">Switzer</name>'s, his is a how-to book. In appealing to a clientele less educated than the artists, architects, and writers of the Burlington circle, he is concerned less with the poetical values and literary associations of classical <pb n="238"/><pb n="238" type="orig"/>sculpture than with the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain mythological figures in relationship to particular kinds of scenery&#x2014;for instance, the correct placement of Pomona in the fruit garden, Ulysses near a body of water, Pan in the grove, Flora in the flower garden, and Bacchus in the vineyard.</p><p>By contrast to <name type="pname" key="7031">Langley</name>'s simplistic approach by rule rather than by inspiration, <name type="pname" key="7032">Thomas Whately</name> (d. <date when="1772">1772</date>), a government official writing as a landscape connoisseur in <date when="1765">1765</date>, after landscape had been fully "released &#x2026; from the restraints of regularity," provides both a valuable record of the appearance of some of the important gardens designed in the first half of the eighteenth century and an understanding of the transformation of landscape gardening aesthetics as the century continued. While gardening for the British Augustans was an art in which the emblems of classical literature, friendship, family, and nation were important, in <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>'s day, the deities and heroes could quietly steal away as the expressive qualities of nature's own materials&#x2014;"ground, wood, water, and rocks"&#x2014;became the sole means of composing landscapes. Though shorn of temples and other symbolic structures, a well-designed landscape could, nonetheless, evoke a range of moods. <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</hi></title> (<date when="1770">1770</date>) helped promote landscape design as one of the liberal arts. The naturalistic approach it recommended found a receptive audience in <name type="place">France</name>, where this style was known as the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi>. The book was so popular that a second edition was published the same year as the first.</p><p>The kind of gardening <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name> advocated was based on the theories <name type="pname" key="7033">Edmund Burke</name> (<date when="1729">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797">1797</date>) had expounded in <date when="1757">1757</date> in <title><hi rend="italic">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</hi></title>. <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name>, as a follower of <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>, strove to define the correspondences between certain human emotions and particular categories of sensory impression. Sublimity lay in those scenes that, because of their awesome size, sharp colors, loud sound, association with the unknown, and often abrupt irregularity, caused sensations best described as a kind of admiring terror or fearful wonder. Beauty, on the other hand excited "the passion of love, or some correspondent affection" and could be found not, as <name type="pname" key="7226">Descartes</name> and <name type="pname" key="7014">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had found it, in mathematical proportion, but rather in such qualities as smallness, smoothness, delicacy, soft hues, melodious music, gently undulating surfaces, and curving lines. For gardeners, this last quality was of the greatest importance, accounting for the almost complete abandonment of straight lines in favor of the continuous S-curve known as <name type="pname" key="7034">Hogarth</name>'s line of beauty after <name type="pname" key="7034">William Hogarth</name> (<date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764">1764</date>), whose treatise on aesthetics, <title><hi rend="italic">The Analysis of Beauty</hi></title> (<date when="1753">1753</date>), held that wavy and serpentine lines were inherently pleasing to the eye</p><p><name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>'s writing reflected the shift from emblematic to expressive means on the part of contemporary landscape designers. This was reinforced by a growing belief in the power of ruins to inspire a mood of elegiac melancholy, of dark-toned vegetation to turn the thoughts into paths of somber reflection, of bright green meadows to soothe the agitated soul, of sunny fields reminiscent of harvest revels to raise the spirits to the level of gaiety, of still brooks and placid lakes to speak of peace and serenity, of loud tumbling waterfalls to induce a thrilling fear. Water, in particular, was for <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name> a practically indispensable element in the garden. Indeed, according to him, "So various are the characters which water can assume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an impression which it cannot enforce."<ref target="#CH7-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref></p><p><name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>'s contemporary, <name type="pname" key="7035">Horace Walpole</name> (<date when="1717">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797">1797</date>), like <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>, enjoyed the charms of a Thames-side villa. Like <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>, he used his pen to advance the fame of the English garden; between <date when="1771">1771</date> and <date when="1780">1780</date> he wrote the first history of the development of the new style.<ref target="#CH7-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref> Less theoretical and philosophical than <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>, <name type="pname" key="7035">Walpole</name> chose to assign the chief credit for the landscape innovations he both practiced and witnessed all around him not to any general aesthetic evolution but to the imaginative genius of certain individuals, notably <name type="pname" key="7036">Charles Bridgeman</name> (c. <date when="1680">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) and <name type="pname" key="7022">William Kent</name> (<date when="1685">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748">1748</date>).</p><p><name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name> gave practical expression to the ideas of <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name> and <name type="pname" key="7018">Addison</name>, retaining some geometrical lines while banishing topiary, turning <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> into lawns, and opening views into the surrounding countryside. He also gave tangible form to the writings of <name type="pname" key="7029">Stephen Switzer</name>, combining poetical allusions with practical landscapes in the "rural and farm-like way of gardening." <name type="pname" key="7035">Walpole</name> credits <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name> with inventing the ha-ha and loosening up the garden's stiff formality. <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>, however, is his hero. Indeed, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>'s lasting renown is due in no small part to <name type="pname" key="7035">Walpole</name>'s characterization of him as "painter enough to taste the charms of landscape, bold and opinionative enough to dare and to dictate, and born with a genius to strike out a great system from the twilight of imperfect essays.

His background as a dramatist and his grasp of a site's scenic potential as a setting for works of architecture, together with his considerable talent as an architect, account for his legacy of impressive works. <name type="pname" key="7037">Vanbrugh</name> realized the "romantick" qualities of <name type="place" subtype="site">Claremont</name>, buying the property for his own country retreat and then, in <date when="1711">1711</date>, selling it to <name type="pname" key="7038">Sir Thomas Pelham Holles</name>, later earl of Clare, who subsequently employed him to design a striking belvedere as well as a garden, which he surrounded with high bastion walls. (In order to unite the garden and surrounding fields visually, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> later removed and replaced these with a gently curving ha-ha.) <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name>'s most striking contribution to <name type="place" subtype="site">Claremont</name> was the construction of a large turf amphitheater of concave and convex tiers (fig. 7.3).</p><p>At <name type="place" subtype="site">Blenheim</name>, <name type="pname" key="7037">Vanbrugh</name> and <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name> collaborated in the creation of the original landscape. <name type="pname" key="7037">Vanbrugh</name> built the palace and the exceptionally grand neoclassical bridge, and <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name> determined the axial lines and principal features of the landscape.

The villas of <name type="place">Rome</name> itself, with their works of sculpture, paintings, objects of art, and large hunting parks, provided more stimuli for his impressionable senses. <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> was also a stage set designer, and as such he recognized and appreciated the theatrical aspects of Italian gardens and their function as places of luxury and sensory delight.</p><p>In <date when="1733">1733</date>, <name type="pname" key="7039">Lord Cobham</name> retired permanently from active political life. <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> was summoned to <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> to begin its most innovative design phase. This consisted of creating the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Elysian Fields</name> in the valley through which had formerly run the road that approached the house from the east. With the road and the village clustered around <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Stowe Church</name> removed, the valley could be incorporated into the garden as both a demonstration of the new naturalism and a thematic manifestation of political opinion and idealistic patriotism (figs. 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8).</p><p>In <date when="1740">1740</date>, young <name type="pname" key="7008">Lancelot "Capability" Brown</name> found employment at <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name>. <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, who soon became head gardener, is thought to have contributed some of his early-blooming talent to the last landscape completed in <name type="pname" key="7039">Cobham</name>'s lifetime: the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Grecian Valley</name>. The sinuous lines of the valley's tree border complement its gently undulating greensward, giving this part of <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> a particularly Arcadian effect. The seeming simplicity of this design is, in fact, the result of the same extensive excavation and regrading that characterize <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s later landscape compositions. It is in this impression of serenity and breadth that <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s work is distinguished from <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>'s, a fact that becomes apparent as we examine <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name>, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>'s finest work and an expression of his genius for compressing a great deal of poetic power into a small compass.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="place"  subtype="site">Rousham</name></hi></hi></head><p>As a painter and theater set designer, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> thought scenically, not architecturally. Attention to the tonality of vegetation and the effects of perspective achieved through contrasting light and dark foliage; expressive use of evergreens and other trees as screens and as a means of modulating otherwise vapid stretches of lawn; creation of both expectation and surprise by withholding choice prospects from immediate view; and the use of classical (and antique British) structures to enliven the distant scene; juxtaposition of the working landscape with the idyllic&#x2014;these were <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>'s techniques as a designer. At <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name>, in <name type="place">Oxfordshire</name>, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> gave full expression to these painterly concepts of landscape design.</p><p><name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name>, which is still owned by the <name type="pname" key="7042">Dormer family</name>, was the eighteenth-century estate of <name type="pname" key="7043">Colonel Robert Dormer</name> and his younger brother <name type="pname" key="7044">James Dormer</name>, a lieutenant-general. <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name> was a friend and correspondent of both brothers and a frequent visitor to <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name>. <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>, who was brought to <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name> by <name type="pname" key="7044">General Dormer</name> following his brother's death in <date when="1737">1737</date>, was commissioned to develop a garden within the framework of <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name>'s plan of the <date when="1720">1720</date>s. It is likely that <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> visited <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name> while he was working at<pb n="241"/><pb n="241" type="orig"/><name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name>, and he may have collaborated with <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name>, sketching some of the ideas that <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name>, with his superior technical ability, subsequently incorporated in the finished plan.</p><p>Because of its cramped and highly irregular site, everything depended upon enlarging the garden's apparent extent by, in <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>'s words, "calling in the country" beyond the ha-ha. The river <name type="place">Cherwell</name>, which traverses the property, serves in effect as part of the encompassing ha-ha system, and the bucolic views of the fields lying on its opposite bank were, even in <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name>'s early plan, essential components of <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name>'s landscape. To these <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> added a sham ruin, built to resemble a single gabled wall with arches, which rose at the top of a ridge about a mile from the river and was known simply as <name type="place" subtype="subsite">"the Eyecatcher."</name> Near the river, he restyled an old mill, rechristened the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Temple of the Mill</name>, in the Gothic manner to add further picturesque interest to the scene. <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name> had already replaced the old terraced garden in front of the house with a large rectangular bowling green. Its raised borders are defined by ranks of trees channeling the view to the gently rolling fields beyond the <name type="place">Cherwell</name>. <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> sited <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" subtype="feature">Lion Attacking a Horse</name></hi>, a copy of an antique sculpture, at the end of the bowling green in front of the open slope leading to the river.</p><p>The path from the bowling green leads to the narrowest part of the garden facing the river's sharp elbow-bend. Because of the angle cut by the river, the garden is severely pinched at this point, but <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> cleverly turned a defect into an asset, making this "hinge" the site of his <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Praeneste Terrace</name>, so named because of his familiarity with the ruined arcades built in tiers on the hillside at <name type="place" subtype="site">Palestrina</name> (ancient Praeneste) from which his design, abbreviated to a single arcade, took its inspiration. The visitor is invited to tarry here on an elegant stone settee sheltered within one of the niches of the arcade.</p><p>West of the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Praeneste Terrace</name>, the slope cradles a gentle valley. <name type="pname" key="7036">Bridgeman</name> had remodeled a series of descending fishponds into a chain of ornamental basins. <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> reconfigured these when he formed the idyllic <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Vale of Venus</name> (fig. 7.4). Beyond the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Venus Vale</name>, in a thickly planted grove of trees, he placed a sinuous rill. This narrow channel forms an elegant wavy line leading the eye from the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Octagonal Pond</name> beneath the arched cascade, over which Venus with her attendant swans and cupids presides, to the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Cold Bath</name>, a much smaller octagonal pool reflecting the dappled light of the small glade in which it is set.</p><p>From a lower path, there are uphill views of the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Vale of Venus</name>, where Pan emerges from the trees to spy on Venus. One can also see the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Praeneste Terrace</name> and, beyond the sharp bend in the river, Bacchus, Mercury, and Ceres assembled in a semicircular glade. Although these sculptures evoke the antique world, they do not furnish the garden with as explicit an iconography as that found at Stowe. This may be so because <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>, by temperament and because he lacked a classical education, hewed to a decorative and scenographic approach to landscape design.</p><p>By contrast, there were several aristocratic cognoscenti who wanted to infuse their landscape improvements with literary themes as well as painterly perspectives. <name type="pname" key="7045">Virgil</name>, <name type="pname" key="7046">Ovid</name>, and <name type="pname" key="7012">Milton</name> were never far from their minds as they set about this task, nor were the sentiments expressed by their contemporary, <name type="pname" key="7028">Thomson</name>, who wrote the ode "Rule, Britannia." It is not surprising therefore to see in the gardens of these British Augustans patriotic evocations of a new imperial Golden Age. In <name type="pname" key="7235">Alberti</name>, whose <title><hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi></title> was first published in English in <date when="1726">1726</date>, they found a mentor on classical architecture and the amenities of country life. Likewise, they eagerly studied the letters of <name type="pname" key="7230">Pliny the Younger</name>, who had divided his time between affairs of state and the pleasures of fruitful leisure at his country estates. Whether working as their own designers or with professionals to create gardens of heroic allusion&#x2014;which were, in effect, statements of pride in <name type="place">England</name>'s own embarkation upon the course of empire&#x2014;these garden owners took their place in the long tradition of Renaissance humanism.</p><figure xml:id="fig-280"><graphic url="CH7_005.jpg"/><figDesc>7.4. <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Vale of Venus</name>, <name type="place" subtype="site">Rousham</name>, <name type="place">Oxfordshire</name>, designed by <name type="pname" key="7022">William Kent</name>.

Here the visitor was given an experience to inspire the noblest patriotic thoughts. As a terminus at the eastern end of the great <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Cross Walk</name>, which symbolized the route into the imaginary Elysium, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> erected the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Temple of Ancient Virtue</name> <hi rend="bold">B</hi>, modeled after the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Temple of Vesta</name> at <name type="place" subtype="site">Tivoli</name> (see fig. 7.6). Inside the circular temple were statues of <name type="pname" key="7027">Homer</name>, <name type="pname" key="7048">Socrates</name>, <name type="pname" key="7049">Epaminondas</name>, and <name type="pname" key="7050">Lycurgus</name> by the Belgian sculptor <name type="pname" key="7051">Peter Scheemakers</name> (<date when="1691">1691</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770">1770</date>), representing respectively poetry, philosophy, military genius, and law. Gazing from the mound upon which it rested, one could see nearby the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Temple of Modern Virtue</name>, a sham ruin (now destroyed) bearing a sculpted headless torso, which supposedly represented <name type="pname" key="7052">Robert Walpole</name>. (Understandably, <name type="pname" key="7035">Horace Walpole</name>, his son, later deplored the use of satire as an iconographic device in garden architecture.)</q><q>On the opposite bank of a small stream named for the river <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Styx</name>, <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> sited the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Temple of British Worthies</name> <hi rend="bold">F</hi>, which featured pedimented niches containing busts of English heroes (see fig. 7.7). Significantly, the still-living <name type="pname" key="7001">Alexander Pope</name> was afforded a place on the return elevation of the range containing <name type="pname" key="7053">Shakespeare</name>, <name type="pname" key="7012">Milton</name>, and <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>. Not without humor, another niche on the back of the temple was sacred to the memory of one Signor Fido, a lamented hunting dog. The bust of Mercury, which adorns the central pyramid, symbolizes the messenger of the gods who will guide these and other worthies such as <name type="pname" key="7039">Lord Cobham</name> across the river Styx to take their places in the Elysian Fields among the exalted heroes within the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Temple of Ancient Virtue</name>.

They took the then-radical step of conceiving of architecture in relationship to scenery, allowing the site to dictate the location of the new house parallel to, rather than on axis with, the approach road (fig. 7.10). As at Stowe, the creators of <name type="place" subtype="site">Castle Howard</name>'s landscape destroyed a village without apparent remorse as the Anglo-Palladian great house with its magnificent cupola, the first of its kind in <name type="place">England</name>, took command of the sweeping view to the south.</p><p>Adjacent to the eastern flank of the house rose a dome-shaped hill known as <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Wray Wood</name> where between <date when="1718">1718</date> and <date when="1732">1732</date>, possibly with advice from <name type="pname" key="7029">Switzer</name>, <name type="pname" key="7059">Carlisle</name> boldly conceived a plan of meandering paths and various fountains set within a naturalistic plantation of trees. Bisecting a stately north-south approach road about 500 yards (457 meters) west of the house, a cross avenue carried one past the entrance court to a terminus at the edge of Wray Wood.

His nickname Capability, from his frequent assurance to his clients that their properties had the <hi rend="italic">capability</hi> of being rendered beautiful by their expenditures and his improving hand, expresses succinctly the flavor of the enterprise. Between the time he left his position as head gardener at <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> in <date when="1751">1751</date> and his death in <date when="1783">1783</date>, he had designed or redesigned nearly two hundred properties, and his advice had been sought on many others. He traveled tirelessly from one to another of his commissions. The often-narrated anecdote about <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s turning down a job in <name type="place">Ireland</name> with the excuse that he had not finished <name type="place">England</name> yet is more than humorous: His vision was a grandly optimistic one in which he must have seen all of <name type="place">England</name> re-created as idealized rural scenery. <hi rend="italic">Taste</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi>&#x2014;operative<pb n="248"/><pb n="248" type="orig"/>words in the eighteenth century&#x2014;were, along with the financial resources necessary to activate them, all that seemed required to achieve this desirable end. The garden, which since the seventeenth century had been expanding visually to embrace spaces beyond its borders, was, in <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s terms, all of a piece with this larger landscape; a garden was simply a rural working landscape arranged so as to be at once productive and beautiful.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s style, stripped of association, was in its own way as abstractly classical as that of <name type="pname" key="7014">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, and the volume of earth movement and topographical regrading required to achieve his seemingly naturalistic results was no less monumental than that required by the French master. <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s eye was selective; it edited out the blemishes of nature, smoothing away abrupt contours and camouflaging its "accidents" with screening foliage. He was often referred to as a "landscape improver,"<ref target="#CH7-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> and with the unconscious presumption of a deity he set about <hi rend="italic">correcting</hi> nature to conform with an aesthetic ideal, which the poet <name type="pname" key="7028" >Thomson</name> hailed as "purest truth." Although <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> left no written theory, he undoubtedly believed that through rational science landscape could be perfected to a state wherein human beings and nature could meet on equal terms, in fruitful partnership.</p><p>From a technical point of view, other things were necessary as well, and in this regard <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> came to his profession far better prepared than <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>. Although <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> spent his youth in the small <name type="place">Northumberland</name> village of <name type="place">Kirkharle</name> where he was born, he was able to observe the estate improvement occurring in the immediate vicinity. His walk to school in <name type="place">Cambo</name> took him past <name type="place" subtype="site">Wallington Park</name>, which, after enclosure, was enjoying various improving alterations to its previously barren and degraded landscape. These included the kind of large-scale reforestation and hedgerow planting ubiquitous in <name type="place">England</name> at the time. In <date when="1732">1732</date>, after leaving school, he became a gardener at <name type="place" subtype="site">Kirkharle Hall</name> where <name type="pname" key="7072">Sir William Loraine</name> was creating a similar working landscape. Here <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> learned to drain swamps and acquired a practical knowledge of horticulture. It was with these skills that he left home, in <date when="1739">1739</date>, for <name type="place">Oxfordshire</name> in the south, finding employment first at <name type="place" subtype="site">Kiddington Hall</name> and then, two years later, at <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name>.</p><p>It was <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s lucky exposure to <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>'s recent work in the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Elysian Fields</name> at <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> that broadened his aesthetic horizons, while his employment by <name type="pname" key="7039">Lord Cobham</name> allowed him to expand his professional abilities. Surveying, hydraulic engineering, and architecture were skills he readily acquired. He became sufficiently competent as a draftsman to develop plans for various neighboring estates, whose owners soon sought his services. Site planning came easily to him, and he quickly found himself not only recommending the placement of various manor houses but designing them as well. Within the bounds of a conventional Palladianism, he provided his clients with mansions and garden buildings that were remarkable for their sound construction, comfort, and convenience.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> was probably familiar with the aesthetics of landscape from an intellectual perspective and referred to his design activity as "Place-making."<ref target="#CH7-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref> In <date when="1753">1753</date>, <name type="pname" key="7034">William Hogarth</name> (<date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764">1764</date>) published <title><hi rend="italic">An Analysis of Beauty</hi></title>, a book devoted to a minute analysis of the way in which that quality is to be found in the sinuous, rather than the straight, line. The first of several editions of <name type="pname" key="7033">Edmund Burke</name>'s treatise <title><hi rend="italic">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</hi></title> appeared in <date when="1757">1757</date>. In it <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name> set forth his concept of beauty as a "feminine" ideal composed of smoothness and softly rounded contours. He elaborated this definition in sensuous terms, likening beauty to the charm "of being swiftly drawn in an easy coach on a smooth turf, with gradual ascents and declivities,"<ref target="#CH7-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref> the intention thus being to produce a pleasing and harmoniously varied experience.</p><p>Whether or not <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> was a student of <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name> and <name type="pname" key="7034">Hogarth</name> in a conscious sense, their ideas were part of a Rococo aesthetic found in mid-eighteenth-century Georgian design, as characterized by the flowing lines and naturalistic forms of <name type="pname" key="7073">Thomas Chippendale</name>'s furniture. It is not surprising, therefore, that <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s style was based upon an undulating linearity of ground plane edges, combined with rounded topographic modeling. <name type="place">Southern England</name> naturally offers just such gentle and varied beauty as that recommended by <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name>'s definition, making the improver's art there merely one of emphasis. Thus, by rearranging certain landscape elements, <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> was readily able to achieve compositions that met <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name>'s criteria for the beautiful.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, having discarded the emblematic garden, expressed mood through more abstract means than temples, monuments, and inscriptions. "Solemn" groves provided variety and contrast to "cheerful" fields. Placid sky-reflecting water was used almost invariably to bring an air of tranquil repose to the scene. Although he was described as working with "the Poet's feeling" and "the Painter's eye," <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> attempted neither to evoke <name type="pname" key="7045">Virgil</name> nor render a three-dimensional painting by <name type="pname" key="7024">Claude</name>. By contrast, the very Englishness of his landscapes inspired poetry and themselves became the subjects of paintings by such British artists as <name type="pname" key="7074">John Constable</name> (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>) and <name type="pname" key="7075">John Mallord William Turner</name> (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>).</p><p><name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s work displays a strong plastic sensibility. He achieved the smoothness that <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name> prized by extensive regrading and by removing all rough obstacles<pb n="249"/><pb n="249" type="orig"/> and "accidental" defects from the terrain. The resulting topography is never flat nor monotonously sloping in one direction, but shaped to form a series of gentle convex and concave curves. Where a slope meets a level plane of lawn or water, <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> created a soft tangential curve called a "concave scoop," and many of his finest views appear as long dells with higher ground softly swelling on either side (fig. 7.17). Trees are never planted in ranks, but rather in clumps, belts, and screens that partially reveal more distant prospects. He used both deciduous and evergreen native species for the most part, following <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>'s practice of contrasting light and dark foliage in order to realize effects of perspective. The curving lines of his drives, tree belts, and lake edges never run along parallel courses, but in harmonious naturalistic configurations.</p><p>His ha-has, placed at right angles to the line of vision, ensure that these sunk fences are imperceptible to the eye traveling to the fields beyond, and their sides slope gradually so as to permit cattle to browse at their edges, thereby eliminating obtrusive tufts of spiky vegetation. Deer still graze in several of his parks, cropping the grass, and by clearing the lower branches of the trees up to a uniform line, they make possible long views through the woods.</p><p>A necessary component of <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s landscapes was an element of suspense. The same kind of hideand-reveal tactics that we will discern when we examine Japanese gardens can also be recognized in his. The belts of trees, designed to screen his circuit drives, some working fields, and other "eyesores" were planned with gaps to expose those aspects of the agricultural landscape that harmonized with his designs. His walks and drives were designed to entice carriage rides and perambulation, and his broad lakes invited visual exploration, but he never allowed eye and body to traverse the same route. Straight lines do not exist in <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s compositions, and it is only by means of a leisurely circuitous amble that one gains the object in view.

Nature's Canvas: English Philosophers and Practitioners of the Picturesque</hi></hi></head><p>In our age of adventure travel, packaged sight-seeing, and resort vacations, it is difficult to comprehend the seriousness of eighteenth-century tourists, their careful characterization of different categories of scenery, and the finely wrought discriminations they made among them. Readers of <name type="pname" key="7081">Jane Austen</name>'s novels can appreciate the intensity of the aesthetic debate within polite society during this period of active transformation of the English landscape. The fervor with which this discussion of the appropriateness of a particular landscape style was conducted at that time appears comically quaint in our own when design diversity has itself become a cultural value. Vast social changes, carried by swift currents of history even as these debates occurred, soon made the practice of landscape design a public responsibility rather than a private entertainment, and the arguments over the respective merits of the Picturesque style versus the smoothly undulating landscapes of <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> came to seem no more consequential than a spirited difference of opinion within a gentlemen's club. But club arguments can assume a degree of rancor that divides people into ardent factions, and the charges and countercharges that are hurled in the heat of battle sometimes echo for years after their participants are gone.</p><p>The Picturesque controversy was taken up by the periodicals of the day, after which it became table talk in country houses throughout the land. This was so because people had begun to regard sight-seeing as a delightful form of recreation. Carriage travel had<pb n="252"/><pb n="252" type="orig"/>become relatively convenient and safe, but revolution in <name type="place">France</name> and other political disturbances made tourist excursions on the Continent difficult. Many people were therefore eager to have their eyes opened to the charms of native scenery. Instructing them in this regard and instilling in them a new concept of regionalism and a new approach to the aesthetics of the natural landscape were the works of <name type="pname" key="7082">William Gilpin</name>.</p><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname" key="7082">William Gilpin</name>, Vicar of Boldre</hi></hi></head><p><name type="pname" key="7082">William Gilpin</name> (<date when="1724">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804">1804</date>), who was brought up in the north of <name type="place">England</name> beside the Scottish border, was an early admirer of wilder and more rugged landscapes than those of southern <name type="place">England</name>. Tutored by his father in painting and sketching, he instinctively viewed landscape as artistic subject matter wherein craggy topography and a certain roughness of objects provided greater variety and visual interest than smooth and flowing perfection. His discriminating eye led him to an appreciation of the different varieties of natural scenery as one traveled from one section of <name type="place">England</name> to another. As developed by <name type="pname" key="7082">Gilpin</name>, the term <hi rend="italic">Picturesque</hi> did not apply to gardens, which "want the bold roughness of nature," and were therefore uninteresting subjects for painters. For him, <hi rend="italic">Picturesque</hi> meant scenery that because of its boldly projecting outcrops of rock, contrasts of dark and light, compositional grouping of trees, and other such attributes was either naturally suitable for picture making or, with some compositional correction to foreground, background, or middle ground, could be made so. His appreciation of scenery was as a two-dimensional framed view of a three-dimensional scene, and his visual satisfaction depended on a correspondence between the works of nature and the animated "roughness" of elements and the atmospheric light and shade that give pleasure in a painting. <name type="pname" key="7082">Gilpin</name>'s imagination, therefore, was not excited by wild nature as such, but rather by nature as seen through the filter of art.</p><p>His own talent as a sketchbook artist admirably served his purposes as a travel writer and illustrator of a new and popular way of looking at landscape.</p><figure xml:id="fig-298"><graphic url="CH7_023.jpg"/><figDesc>7.22. <name type="pname" key="7082">William Gilpin</name>, aquatint engraving from <title><hi rend="italic">Remarks on Forest Scenery</hi></title>, <date when="1791">1791</date>. According to <name type="pname" key="7082">Gilpin</name>, "The <hi rend="italic">blasted</hi> tree has often a fine effect both in natural, and in artificial landscape. In some scenes it is almost essential. When the dreary heath is spread before the eye, and ideas of wildness and desolation are required, what more suitable accompaniment can be imagined, than the blasted oak, ragged, scathed and leafless; shooting its peeded, white branches athwart the gathering blackness of some rising storm?"</figDesc></figure><p>As a young clergyman living in <name type="place">London</name>, he visited <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name>, and in <date when="1748">1748</date>, he published anonymously <title><hi rend="italic">A Dialogue upon the Gardens of the Right Honourable the <name type="pname" key="7039">Lord Viscount Cobham</name>, at Stow in Buckinghamshire</hi></title>. In this "conversation" between Callophilus, a lover of beauty, and Polython, a man of sensitivity and imagination from the north of <name type="place">England</name>, he analyzed the famous landscape as if it were a painting. <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name>'s deficiency in <name type="pname" key="7082">Gilpin</name>'s nonetheless admiring eye was its want of Picturesque scenery such as one found in the northern counties where craggy precipices, foaming waterfalls, hanging woods, and other scenes of rough natural beauty abounded. He held that "Regularity and Exactness excite no manner of Pleasure in the Imagination. The fancy is struck by <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> alone; and if <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> does any thing more than just decently improve her, we think she grows impertinent.

He revisited those wild landscapes that had thrilled him as a youth, and he happily spent his days sketching and his evenings writing up his "observations," which were based on an analysis, according to his developing theories of Picturesque beauty, of the scenery he had drawn. He circulated these observations along with sketches from his travels in <name type="place">Wales</name>, the <name type="place">Lake District</name>, and elsewhere in northern <name type="place">England</name> to a growing band of admirers.</p><p>In <date when="1776">1776</date>, he left Cheam School to become the vicar of <name type="place">Boldre</name>, a parish in <name type="place">Hampshire</name> on the border of the <name type="place">New Forest</name> beside the southern coast of <name type="place">England</name>.

In the same way that the eighteenth-century painter or sketch artist avoided a linear style and crisp outline in favor of chiaroscuro effects of light and shade, so according to proponents of the Picturesque, the landscape improver should avoid neat definitions of forms in favor of hazier, less distinct shapes that produced a more "artistic" appearance. <name type="pname" key="7090">Knight</name>'s friend <name type="pname" key="7091">Uvedale Price</name> also deplored the sacrifice of the old hunting parks to the improver's hand,<pb n="254"/><pb n="254" type="orig"/>and his work <title><hi rend="italic">On the Picturesque</hi></title> (<date when="1784">1784</date>), which enjoyed several editions and was extensively read for the better part of a century, inquires "whether the present system of improving &#x2026; is founded on any just principles of taste."<ref target="#CH7-n30"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">30</hi></hi></ref> Like <name type="pname" key="7090">Knight</name>, he believed that a knowledge of the works of the great masters, particularly those of <name type="pname" key="7024">Claude Lorrain</name>, <name type="pname" key="7025">Poussin</name>, <name type="pname" key="7092">Salvator Rosa</name>, and the Dutch school, and an understanding of the <hi rend="italic">principles</hi> of painting&#x2014;"general composition&#x2014;grouping the separate parts&#x2014;harmony of tints&#x2014;unity of character"<ref target="#CH7-n31"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">31</hi></hi></ref>&#x2014;should inform the minds of those who would be improvers.</p><p>According to <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>, in studying painting one readily observes that two interrelated qualities constitute the essence of the Picturesque: <hi rend="italic">intricacy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">variety</hi>. He defines intricacy as "that disposition of objects, which, by a partial and uncertain concealment, excites and nourishes curiosity," while variety in scenery is defined as that which is in opposition to the formulaic perfection of <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>. Monotony is the enemy of the Picturesque, and <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name> deplores that once the "mechanical and commonplace operation, by which <name type="pname" key="7008">Mr. Brown</name> and his followers have gained so much credit," is begun, one is forced to bid "adieu to all that the painter admires&#x2014;to all intricacies&#x2014;to all the beautiful varieties of form, tint, and light and shade; every deep recess&#x2014;every bold projection&#x2014;the fantastic roots of trees&#x2014;the winding paths of sheep" together with "what time only, and a thousand lucky accidents can mature, so as to make [the landscape] become the admiration and study of a <name type="pname" key="7128">Ruysdael</name> or a <name type="pname" key="7236">Gainsborough</name>."<ref target="#CH7-n32"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">32</hi></hi></ref></p><p>Though both were united in their intense opposition to <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, there are distinctions between <name type="pname" key="7090">Knight</name>'s version of Picturesque theory and that of <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>. For <name type="pname" key="7090">Knight</name>, picturesqueness resides within the eye of the beholder who, by "having his mind enriched with the embellishments of the painter and the poet," invests natural objects with "ideal and imaginary beauties; that is, beauties, which are not felt by the organic sense of vision; but by the intellect and imagination through that sense."<ref target="#CH7-n33"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">33</hi></hi></ref> <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>, on the other hand, tries to objectify the Picturesque, making it a separate category alongside <name type="pname" key="7033">Burke</name>'s categories of the beautiful and the sublime.</p><p>While critical of the serpentine outlines of <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s bodies of water, <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name> reserves his greatest scorn for the improver's method of planting trees in clumps. <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s clumps appear to him variously as regimental soldiers on parade or as so many puddings turned out of a mold. He finds even the old arrow-straight approach avenues of an earlier generation preferable to the narrow winding belts of newly planted trees beside <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s drives. In this vein of contrariety, he romantically admires such entrance roads as those leading to <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> and <name type="place" subtype="site">Castle Howard</name> for their solemnity and grandeur, especially at night when a few gleams of moonlight pierce the deep gloom of their dense foliage.</p><p>Practical minds took with a grain of salt <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>'s prescription of negligence as a means toward art. Even his admiring mid-nineteenth-century editor inserted into <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>'s reprinted text a note of warning regarding the advantages of smooth, well-graded carriage roads over picturesquely rough ones. While the Picturesque theorists greatly stimulated a new appetite for travel into the wilder parts of the British Isles, estate improvement, with some increased picturesqueness in the park, continued to develop in a manner derived from <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name> and <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>. That an intermediate position between two perceived polarities prevailed as the English countryside continued to be coaxed into new patterns of domestic felicity was due in large measure to the practice and writings of <name type="pname" key="7093">Humphry Repton</name>.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname" key="7093">Humphry Repton</name></hi></hi></head><p><name type="pname" key="7093">Humphry Repton</name> (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818">1818</date>), <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s self-appointed successor and the inheritor of his practice, felt obliged to seize the gauntlet thrown down by <name type="pname" key="7090">Knight</name> and <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>. He therefore took up his pen to defend the great <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, attempting to show how the principles of painting and landscaping were not, in fact, one and the same as the Picturesque theorists maintained. According to <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>, the landscape subject matter suitable for painting was that which could be contained within the representational confines of the artist's canvas, whereas the beauties of real landscape encompassed those of prospect&#x2014;panoramic views obtained from a lofty ridge or belvedere. He maintained that "the good sense and good taste of this country will never be led to despise the comfort of a gravel walk, the delicious fragrance of a shrubbery, the soul-expanding delight of a wide extended prospect, or a view down a steep hill, because they are all subjects incapable of being painted."<ref target="#CH7-n34"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">34</hi></hi></ref></p><p><name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>, as a professional landscape gardener, had thought it important to discourage amateur improvers who were, in his opinion, in the same position as a patient "quacking himself." Unlike <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, whose schooling was essentially vocational, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> had, in fact, received a gentleman's education and had been led to his professional practice by his own enthusiasm as an amateur improver and the realization that, with <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s death, a vacuum had been created, which a man with small means and a growing family could hope to fill.</p><p>Like his American successor, <name type="pname" key="7087">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, another amateur-turned-landscape-professional, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> found his way to his vocational call<pb n="255"/><pb n="255" type="orig"/>ing by a circuitous route; both were financially unsuccessful in business and as gentleman farmers. <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> decided to adopt a new vocation in <date when="1788">1788</date>. Having moved into a cottage on Hare Street in the <name type="place">Essex</name> village of <name type="place">Romford</name> in order to accommodate his reduced financial circumstances, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>, after a restless night pondering his future, arose, christened himself a "landscape gardener," and had cards printed, which, with the help of his friends, soon brought this new professional nomenclature into currency in the best drawing rooms of <name type="place">England</name>. In order to fulfill his intention of becoming the successor to <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, who had died five years earlier, he set out to see many recently improved estates, including such famous ones as <name type="place" subtype="site">Blenheim</name> <name type="place" subtype="site">Stowe</name> and, following the new fashion for Picturesque travel initiated by <name type="pname" key="7082">Gilpin</name>, he made a sketching tour in <date when="1789">1789</date> of the Essex forests.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s almost immediate success was due to an idea he hit upon at the outset. A talented watercolorist, he would do more than assure his clients of their properties' capabilities; he would demonstrate with his facile pen and brush a series of "before and after" effects. In his <title>Red Books</title>, so named for their red morocco leather bindings, he made watercolor renderings with fold-over flaps. The scene depicted when the flaps were closed was one of rural scenery awaiting landscape improvement. When opened, the part of the image that had been formerly concealed was seen to portray the same landscape as it would appear when transformed by <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s planned improvements. This "existing-and-proposed" format constituted an irresistible ploy, and <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s clients were happy to pay his charge for producing a <title>Red Book</title> in addition to his usual fee for his survey work and recommendations on property improvement (figs. 7.24a, 7.24b). The volumes became proud tokens of their possessing that characteristic most prized by eighteenth-century polite society: good taste. They served, of course, in addition, as discreet advertisements of <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s work, helping to attract future clients.</p><p>In <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>, <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, who had left no written record of his principles of design, found a proponent in much the same way as <name type="pname" key="7014">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> gained influence through the influential treatise of <name type="pname" key="7015">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>. But, although <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s professed heir and the grateful recipient, from <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s son, of maps of the estates where his father had worked, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> had imbibed the Picturesque sensibility of his time. In subtle ways, he distanced himself increasingly over the years from the system devised by the famous improver. Indeed, he advocated no system at all, but rather <hi rend="italic">good taste</hi> based on certain principles first developed in the Red Books and later articulated in printed books after he realized that he could broaden the audience for his ideas, increase the reputation of his work, and supplement his income through publication. <title><hi rend="italic">Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening</hi></title> (<date when="1795">1795</date>) was followed by other works, including <title><hi rend="italic">Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</hi></title> (<date when="1803">1803</date>), and a final collection of thoughts gathered from a busy lifetime, <title><hi rend="italic">Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</hi></title> (<date when="1816">1816</date>).</p><p>Like <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> conceived his landscape ideas pictorially. Perspectives, rather than plans, were his chief means of expression (although, unlike <name type="pname" key="7022">Kent</name>, he did produce plans for his clients). As painting was his stock-in-trade and he was responsible for more than three thousand sketches and the multiplication of some of these many times over through published engravings, he was particularly stung when <name type="pname" key="7090">Richard Payne Knight</name> in his essay <title><hi rend="italic">An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste</hi></title> (<date when="1805">1805</date>) took exception to the term <hi rend="italic">landscape gardening</hi> and attacked <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> personally by suggesting that "he who gave it the title may explain [why a practice that had produced] not one complete painter's composition [in many of the] beautiful and picturesque spots" of <name type="place">England</name> should be so called.<ref target="#CH7-n35"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">35</hi></hi></ref></p><figure xml:id="fig-300"><graphic url="CH7_025.jpg"/><figDesc>7.24a and b. <name type="pname" key="7093">Humphry Repton</name>, hand-colored aquatint of Water at <name type="place" subtype="site">Wentworth</name>, <name type="place">Yorkshire</name>, depicting existing and proposed landscapes, from <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening</hi></title>, <date when="1803">1803</date></figDesc></figure><p><name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> felt compelled to mount a defense, and his rebuttal, <title><hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Changes of Taste inLandscape Gardening</hi></title> (<date when="1806">1806</date>)<pb n="256"/><pb n="256" type="orig"/>, once again exonerated <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, blaming his uninspired followers for those crimes of clumping too tightly and belting too narrowly that were abhorrent to the warriors of the wild Picturesque. At the same time, he tactfully described concessions that he deemed appropriate for the sake of convenience and comfort, such as the reunification of the kitchen garden with the house or the design of the drive leading to the house not as a circuitous excursion but as a more direct route, though these things were in contradiction to <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>'s practice. Attending to the practical needs of his clients, he made the <hi rend="italic">porte coch&#x00E8;re</hi> a regular feature in his plans.</p><figure xml:id="fig-301"><graphic url="CH7_026.jpg"/><figDesc>7.25. <name type="place" subtype="site">Endsleigh</name>, <name type="place">Devonshire</name>, where <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> effected an architectural transition between house and garden, bringing into favor ornamental horticulture in the environs of the house.

In <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s plans, the balustraded terrace that <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> had banned found its way back to the house where it served as a zone of transition between architecture and landscape. Participating in the explosion of interest in botany occurring in his day, he incorporated exotic shrubs and trees in his plans and even allowed the flower garden, which had been categorically banished by <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name> and despised by the advocates of the wild Picturesque, to exist once more in the vicinity of the house (fig. 7.25). He grasped the benefits to horticulture as well as the decorative possibilities inherent in industrial technology and found many uses for a new material, cast iron, both as ornament and as <hi rend="italic">treillage</hi>. His pergolas and trellis arches, of both cast iron and wood, diminished the classicism of the landscape and soon became mainstays of the Victorian garden. The cast-iron-and-glass conservatories for tender plants he introduced as gardenlike extensions of the house had a similar result.</p><p>Although horrified at the excesses committed in <name type="place">France</name> in the name of equality, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> had a sharper social conscience than had <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>. Villages were no longer swept away because they marred a view; now their inherent picturesqueness served to complement the landscapes of great houses (fig. 7.26). Such ordinary landscapes are the domain of cultural geographers today and were, as we shall read in Chapter Eleven, also appreciated by the Edwardian garden designer <name type="pname" key="7094">Gertrude Jekyll</name> (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1932">1932</date>), who lovingly photographed the cottages, gardens, and farmsteads of rural <name type="place">Surrey</name> at the time when these components of the rural English scene were rapidly disappearing. If we were to chart the general attitude toward the vernacular environment among people of social influence, we might say that <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> points the way toward a more democratic and all-encompassing view of landscape and of the place-making achievements of common folk. In any case, by the end of his career, the era of great estate landscaping was effectively over, and the<pb n="257"/><pb n="257" type="orig"/>challenge that those who came after <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> addressed was one of inculcating the principles of taste within the ranks of a prosperous and expanding middle class.</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname" key="7095">John Nash</name>, <name type="pname" key="7099">John Wood</name>, and the Regency Townscape</hi></hi></head><p>Unlike <name type="pname" key="7008">Brown</name>, who practiced architecture himself, <name type="pname" key="7093">Humphrey Repton</name> associated with professional architects in the execution of his commissions. His eldest son, <name type="pname" key="7097">John Adey Repton</name> (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">1860</date>), became an enthusiastic antiquarian and architect, apprenticing first in his father's office and later working in that of <name type="pname" key="7095">John Nash</name> (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">1835</date>). <name type="pname" key="7093">Humphrey Repton</name> and <name type="pname" key="7095">John Nash</name> enjoyed a profitable professional association for a few years beginning in <date when="1796">1796</date>.

Here, promenades were created as bands of greenery, and housing blocks were built around landscaped squares and on terraces with broad views of open countryside (fig. 7.27). These urban design amenities made <name type="place" subtype="site">Bath</name> a new kind of city, one that married genteel architecture with natural scenery. Immediately popular, the town became in the eighteenth century a favorite locale for members of the aristocracy and gentry seeking to improve their health. It was moreover a place of amusement and social diversion. The atmosphere of friendliness and mild license, restrained by rules of social etiquette, provided opportunities for encounters among members of the opposite sex, creating the town's reputation of being a marriage market.</p><p>First, <name type="pname" key="7099">Wood the Elder</name> laid out <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Queen Square</name> (<date when="1729">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1736">36</date>) in the trim Regency architectural style. He next developed the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Grand Parade</name> (<date when="1740">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743">43</date>), with green vistas beyond the river Avon. Another residential grouping, the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Circus</name> (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758">58</date>) followed, in which a unified ring of houses was built around a central open space. <name type="pname" key="7096">Wood the Younger</name> built the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Royal Crescent</name> (<date when="1767">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1775">75</date>), and <name type="pname" key="7100">John Palmer</name> established the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">Lansdown Crescent</name> (<date when="1794">1794</date>) on the slope above it (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794">94</date>).

The <name type="place" subtype="site">Marylebone Park Crown Estate</name>, as <name type="place" subtype="site">Regent's Park</name> was originally known, was, like <name type="place" subtype="site">Hyde Park</name>, subsequently put up for sale by <name type="pname" key="7102">Cromwell</name>'s Puritanical <name type="pname" key="7243" subtype="corp">Parliament</name>.

After some financial and practical difficulties were overcome, a crescent of stuccoed houses with uniform facades was built along the outer perimeter of the southern part of the park. Only eight of Nash's originally planned fifty-six independent villas were built, nor was the interior ring of row houses realized, and the park gradually began to accommodate other uses.<ref target="#CH7-n36"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">36</hi></hi></ref> In spite of the lack of demand for its proposed villas, <name type="place" subtype="site">Regent's Park</name> provided an influential example for future suburban-style development in <name type="place">London</name> and elsewhere, and many later speculations in real estate bore the word "Park" as part of their name.</p><p>While most squares in <name type="place">London</name>, unlike those in <name type="place">Paris</name>, had been conceived as patches of greenery, they could hardly be called Picturesque.

In addition, the effects of the Industrial Revolution were beginning to transform both urban and rural life. These cultural currents profoundly altered the enterprise of landscape design, making it only marginally the prerogative of princes and the pastime of the landed gently. The values of a prosperous aristocracy would soon be superseded by the commercialism of a new manufacturing class.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>, who had a normally cheerful disposition, was disturbed by the social dislocations of the Napoleonic wars and the consequent heartless life of mercenary opportunists; Becky Sharp, the protagonist of <title><hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi></title> (<date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">48</date>) by <name type="pname" key="7112">William Makepeace Thackeray</name>, is a fictional portrayal of such a type. The superficial life of fashionable <name type="place" subtype="site">Bath</name> was as alien to <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>'s temperament as it was to <name type="pname" key="7081">Jane Austen</name>'s. Like <name type="pname" key="7011">William Wordsworth</name> and <name type="pname" key="7006">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</name>, <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name> recognized that sensibility was the common property of the human soul rather than merely the province of an educated upper class. He was able to embrace the view of nature as a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> good and of landscape design as a <hi rend="italic">social</hi> responsibility. His was a liberal-minded paternalism that was still tied to the old agrarian society, now in transition. Dorothea Brooke in <title><hi rend="italic">Middlemarch</hi></title> (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872">72</date>) by <name type="pname" key="7114">George Eliot</name>, with her plans for improving tenant cottages, would have been a heroine after his heart.

Perhaps his greatest gift to posterity was the good sense he conferred upon the Picturesque style, modifying it and making it a practicable idiom for the design of the public park, the landscape institution <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of the coming democratic age. Yet even as the forces of revolutionary republicanism were gathering momentum, <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> aristocrats in <name type="place">France</name> put their own particular stamp on the Picturesque style, which was quite different from that of <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>.</p></div></div><div type="section"><pb n="261"/><pb n="261" type="orig"/><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">V.

French eighteenth-century gardens were consciously conceived as stage sets by designers who often also worked in the theater. This aspect of French gardens of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> is perhaps also explained by the fact that they spring out of the dramatic tradition of French pastoral romance, which is filled with bucolic sentiment, rather than from a literary tradition of poetry imbued with moral philosophy, as was the case with the English eighteenth-century garden.</p><p>The structures that ornamented these gardens, called <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi>, were like theatrical scenery, usually rustic in style. The enthusiasm for <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> was such that in the eighteenth-century French gardens that go by the name <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi> they became the whole point, more than was the case in <name type="place">England</name> where the balance between ornamental structures and landscape still favored landscape. Some of these gardens were as hill of theatrical set pieces as <name type="place">Disneyland</name>.</p><p>While this type of garden was built for the amusement of aristocrats in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution, there were other gardens, also of a Picturesque character, in which <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> did not overwhelm nature, where solitary contemplation and quiet friendship were the goal. These were directly influenced by <name type="pname" key="7006">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</name> (<date when="1712">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">1778</date>), a principal progenitor of the Romantic movement, whose writings awakened faculties of perception and an intuitive mode of thought in which sentiment, more than reason, was the governing principle. The French Picturesque garden can thus be characterized as falling into two basic types: those of a theatrical, exotic, and libertine <hi rend="italic">anglo-chinois</hi> character on the one hand, and those of a moral and sentimental Rousseauesque character on the other. The former is epitomized by the <name type="place" subtype="site">Parc Monceau</name>, <name type="pname" key="7115">Carmontelle</name>'s bizarre fantasy creation for the <name type="pname" key="7116">duc de Chartres</name>, a tame remnant of which survives today as a pleasant green oasis in the sixteenth <hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> of <name type="place">Paris</name>.

This apparent attempt to deprive the English of the distinction of having originated their own garden style, and the resentment of this on the part of the English, illustrates the historic rivalry between the two countries.

The agreeable vision of <name type="place">Virginia</name> as a kind of paradise and continental <name type="place">America</name> as fulfilling in reality the antique myth of a pastoral Golden Age encouraged his dream of a society of "genuine virtue" in which men preserved their freedom by turning the immense and potentially fruitful wilderness into independently owned farms.</p><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">The National Grid</hi></hi></head><p><name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, with its large workforce of slaves, was the patrician exemplar of rural life.

But now the American land had both utilitarian economic potential as well as aesthetic importance for those who, like <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name>, could indulge in an appreciation of the beautiful, picturesque, and sublime. In either case, this view of it as a commodity&#x2014;real estate&#x2014;to be bought, cultivated, and sometimes designed for delectation ignored the cosmological meaning of certain <name type="place">American</name> landscapes in Native American eyes.</p><p>Twenty years before <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> advanced his ideal of a nation of continental proportions with the Louisiana Purchase, he had chaired the committee of <name type="pname" key="7242" subtype="corp">Congress</name> that prepared a plan for the Northwest Territory.

Instead of allowing settlement as heretofore according to natural topography, the committee set forth a purely mathematical system that would ensure an orderly,<pb n="268"/><pb n="268" type="orig"/>nondisputatious parceling of land. They established a national grid of 36-mile- (57.9-kilometer-) square townships formed by north-south meridian lines, which were periodically inflected to account for polar convergence, and "range" lines running east-west. The committee further prescribed that the townships be subdivided into 1-mile-square (640-acre) parcels.

Before it became a magnet for visitors after his retirement from public life, <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name> was his retreat where he could pursue his interest in science and philosophy, thanks to his superb library. It was also his agricultural and horticultural experimental station and the place where he first exercised his talents as an architect and landscape designer.</p><p>Methodical by nature, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> faithfully kept a <title>Garden Book</title> in which he noted the planting, bloom, and harvest times of various fruits, flowers, and vegetables. Through this as well as from various architectural diagrams and sketches and from the lively correspondence he carried on with nurserymen and<pb n="269"/><pb n="269" type="orig"/>gardening friends at home and abroad, there emerges not merely the chronicle of the creation of a famous landscape, but also the personality of an eighteenth-century polymath, self-taught architect, and natural scientist. From the <title>Garden Book</title> and his also reliably kept <title>Account Book</title> we learn that, in <date when="1767">1767</date>, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> supervised the sawing of lumber and the planting of fruit trees at the <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name> site; in the following year, he let a contract to level the summit; and in the year after that, he had the foundations dug for his new house. A brick kiln was put in operation and hardware ordered from <name type="place">England</name>.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> owned four editions of <name type="pname" key="7013">Palladio</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Quattro libri dell'architettura</hi></title> (<date when="1570">1570</date>) in which the Venetian architect illustrated the elements of his style. He also owned <title><hi rend="italic">Select Architecture</hi></title> by the eighteenth-century Palladian and classical theorist <name type="pname" key="7151">Robert Morris</name>. But he did not adhere to <name type="pname" key="7013">Palladio</name>'s or to any other architectural book in an academic fashion. Guided by the already derivative and much-altered Palladianism of <name type="place">England</name>, he chose to combine ideas and adapt design forms drawn from several sources to his own sense of utility and comfort. These included the saucer dome over <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>'s parlor, derived from the <name type="place" subtype="site">H&#x00F4;tel de Salm</name> in <name type="place">Paris</name>, the construction of which he had watched with lively interest in <date when="1796">1796</date> during the period he served as minister to <name type="place">France</name>. However, lacking stone and sculptors to carve it, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> eschewed French ornamental elegance; <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, with its simple native brick and chaste classical detailing in whitepainted wood carved by master joiners brought from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, retains an original <hi rend="italic">American</hi>-Palladian flavor (fig. 7.44). The service basement was screened by a long arcaded portico similar to those found in the courtyards of <name type="pname" key="7013">Palladio</name>'s villas; however, the one at <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name> was partially buried in the hillside in order to make the movement of many household slaves and other menials as inconspicuous as possible.</p><p>Even before the house was built, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> began collecting trees and shrubs and sowing seed for vegetables and flowers. He embellished the area in front of the entrance on the east with a hemicycle of flowering shrubs. In addition to planting the orchard and a kitchen garden on the southern slope, he laid out a horseshoe-shaped lawn to the west along the flattened top of the hill. Though clearly of a rationalistic, scientific, and utilitarian bent, his mind was also inclined toward the Romanticism of <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name>. The melancholy potential of the rural cemetery with monuments and elegiac inscriptions gripped his imagination, and he understood from his reading about English gardens the associative value of temples, grottoes, urns, and texts in stone. Thus, in <date when="1771">1771</date>, he thought about choosing for "a Burying place some unfrequented vale in the park &#x2026; among antient and venerable oaks." He planned to erect in the center of this grove "a small Gothic temple of antique appearance, into which would be admitted very little light, perhaps none at all, save only the feeble ray of an half extinguished lamp."<ref target="#CH7-n50"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">50</hi></hi></ref> He also envisioned channeling a stream into a cistern, which might serve as a pool for bathing. At the mouth of the spring he would carve a grotto, to be decorated with translucent pebbles and beautiful shells and in which a sculpture of a sleeping nymph, like the one to be found at <name type="pname" key="7064">Henry Hoare</name>'s <name type="place" subtype="site">Stourhead</name>, would rest on a couch of moss. Other projects engrossed his imagination, including a cascade and various eye-catchers on <name type="place" subtype="site">Mount Alto</name> across from <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>. But while it was in his nature to fantasize architecture and daydream about Picturesque garden scenes, these projects inevitably took a back seat to his more pragmatic horticultural interests. No temple ever rose at <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, no grotto was built to adorn a spring, and instead of the Romantic burial ground, a simple square graveyard enclosed by a fence was established in <date when="1773">1773</date>. Being both practical and artistic, the <hi rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> offered him a more pragmatic landscape paradigm for his improvement of <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>'s grounds. As might be expected, he possessed a copy of <name type="pname" key="7061">William Shenstone</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title> (<date when="1764">1764</date>), which he had purchased a year after its publication when he was only twenty-two.</p><figure xml:id="fig-320"><graphic url="CH7_045.jpg"/><figDesc>7.44. <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, near <name type="place">Charlottesville, Virginia</name></figDesc></figure><pb n="270"/><pb n="270" type="orig"/><p>In <date when="1786">1786</date>, he acquired the second (<date when="1770">1770</date>) edition of <name type="pname" key="7032">Whately</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</hi></title>, and it was with a copy of this book in hand that he set forth during the months of March and April with fellow American <name type="pname" key="7152">John Adams</name>, on a systematic tour of English landscape gardens.

And at <name type="place" subtype="site">Blenheim</name> he had to admit that, in spite of his judgment that "this garden has no great beauties," he was impressed with the cascade and the lake, finding "the water here is very beautiful, very grand."<ref target="#CH7-n52"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">52</hi></hi></ref> With an abundance of fine native plants, the creation of American gardens was, he thought optimistically, more a matter of pruning and editing out what was unwanted.</p><p>On his retirement from public life in <date when="1809">1809</date>, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> set in motion a final campaign of landscaping at <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>. He enlarged the terraced vegetable garden south of the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">central lawn</name> to a length 1,000 feet (304.8 meters), beautified it with a small garden pavilion, and rearranged its beds so as to make it more agreeable for viewing from above. He laid out a serpentine path within the horseshoe-shaped lawn and created oval beds where he could display the many species of bulbs and flowers that he continually collected. He built a ha-ha to separate the lawn and pleasure grounds from the agricultural landscape. He constructed three circular drives, or <name type="place" subtype="subsite">roundabouts</name>, each one progressively larger in circumference, for touring the property Between the second and third he planted various experimental crops.</p><p>To his gardening friend <name type="pname" key="7153">William Hamilton</name>, the owner of <name type="place" subtype="site">The Woodlands</name> in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> wrote in <date when="1806">1806</date> near the end of his second presidential term and in anticipation of his resumption of active gardening at <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, speculating upon how, in the climate of <name type="place">Virginia</name>, which was benign and favorable to horticulture but yet too warm in summer to be as comfortable as the "sunless climate" of <name type="place">England</name>, one could achieve some of the same effects.

In his political and social theory, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> embraced a wide intellectual range, sometimes encompassing contradictory perspectives. His pastoralism and antiurbanism, for instance, were inconsistent with the growth of an independent manufacturing economy in <name type="place">America</name>, which he advanced as a matter of national expedience. When compared with <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, <name type="place" subtype="site">Poplar Forest</name>, a project of mathematically derived proportions and geometrical forms, demonstrates that as a landscape designer he was equally capable of pursuing divergent ends. In his library was a copy of <name type="pname" key="7015">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pratique du jardinage</hi></title>, and in <date when="1805">1805</date>, at the time he was planning the <name type="place" subtype="site">Poplar Forest</name> villa, he purchased <name type="pname" key="7155">Wilhelm Gottlieb Becker</name>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Neue Garten-und Landschafts-Geb&#x00E4;ude</hi></title> (<date when="1798">1798</date>) in which there is a plate illustrating an octagonal garden pavilion with a central space that is 20 feet (6.1 meters) square, a plan that also calls to mind in its symmetry and four equally prominent facades <name type="pname" key="7013">Palladio</name>'s<pb n="271"/><pb n="271" type="orig"/><name type="place" subtype="site">Villa Rotonda</name>. Transforming the villa's measurements to a ratio of 2:5 (the obverse of the Golden Section), <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> designed an octagonal house 50 feet (15.2 meters) in diameter with a central room measuring 20 feet (6.1 meters) to a side, which serves as the linchpin of his geometrical landscape design (figs. 7.45a, 7.45b).</p><p>Although <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> was familiar with <name type="pname" key="7015">D&#x00E9;zallier</name>, <name type="place" subtype="site">Poplar Forest</name>'s landscape was no formulaic application of French garden theory and practice. His interests in mathematics and classical history became increasingly important pastimes in his retirement, for as he confided to <name type="pname" key="7152">John Adams</name> in <date when="1812">1812</date>, "I have given up newspapers in exchange for <name type="pname" key="7156">Tacitus</name> and <name type="pname" key="7157">Thucydides</name>, for <name type="pname" key="7000">Newton</name> and <name type="pname" key="7158">Euclid</name>; and I find myself much the happier." At <name type="place" subtype="site">Poplar Forest</name>, interlocking mathematical shapes&#x2014;circles, squares, and squared circles, or octagons&#x2014;are composed within the framework of a 100-foot (30.5-meter) modular system. Its design has cosmological overtones, the mandala-like image of its landscape plan coincidentally echoing forms and alignments found in prehistoric cultures. Its principal entrance faces due north, and its octagonal shape allows for fenestration that is oriented to the <name type="place">Blue Ridge</name>, the <name type="place">Peaks of Otter</name>, and other important local mountains. The <name type="place" subtype="subsite">entry drive</name> has a circular terminus like that at <name type="place" subtype="site">Mount Vernon</name>, but here its circularity is made emphatic by an outer ring of boxwood trees and an inner concentric ring of five dwarf boxwood hedges, which are divided into four sections by being broken at the cardinal points. <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> had the <name type="place" subtype="subsite">south lawn</name> graded to form a grass <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi>, or bowling green. It, too, is more mathematically pronounced than the one at <name type="place" subtype="site">Mount Vernon</name>, being exactly 100 feet (30.5 meters) wide by 200 feet (61 meters) long.</p><p><name type="place" subtype="site">Poplar Forest</name>'s most unusual design feature, two circular 12-foot- (3.7-meter-) high <name type="place" subtype="subsite">mounds</name> placed 100 feet equidistant from the east and west fronts of the house, had four willows planted on their tops. These formed a 20-foot (6.1-meter) square&#x2014;the same dimension and shape as the central room of the octagon. More willows encircled the mounds at their midpoint, and at their bases, which are 100 feet (30.5 meters) in diameter, <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> planted an outer ring of aspens. The entire composition of house, dependencies, and garden was encompassed by a <name type="place" subtype="subsite">circular ring road</name> 500 feet (152.4 meters) in diameter. This road was lined with paper mulberries, prized by <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> for the regularity of their form. Thus, in the end, did <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name>'s penchant for mathematical relationships and classical geometries prevail over the tendency toward the Picturesque as expressed in his daydream of a dimly lit Gothic temple as his burial chamber on the grounds of <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>.

His essays at <name type="place" subtype="site">Monticello</name>, <name type="place" subtype="site">Poplar Forest</name>, and the <name type="place" subtype="site">University of Virginia</name> belong to a long aristocratic tradition of garden design. It is significant in this regard that <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name> was a man much at home in the French court, an Enlightenment rationalist whose fundamental design preference was for Neoclassical forms. It is important to remember also that he was a slave owner as well as the author of the Declaration of Independence. In assessing his importance to the landscape of <name type="place">America</name>, we must not forget that he expressed the country's future as a democratic (and commercial) society in his deployment of the nonhierarchical national grid as a means of subdividing the continent and selling its land. Of particular importance to his nineteenth-century successors, including especially <name type="pname" key="7169">Andrew Jackson Downing</name> and <name type="pname" key="7087">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, was his pastoral vision of an agricultural society and a nation vast enough to accom-modate those aspects of the nascent industrial technology as would benefit it but still leave it unscarred, unpolluted, and un-urban. This was his hopeful, and, in retrospect, poignant legacy to the American landscape.</p></div></div><div type="section"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">VII.

The ideals of political revolution were inherent in Romanticism's allegiance to the innate worth of the individual. The old order was fading; aristocratic privilege was gradually being supplanted by notions of equality. Increasingly, entitlement would have less to do with hereditary titles than with the concept of life, liberty, and happiness as the birthright of all human beings. Even in countries that were still monarchies, political systems were evolving that would support in a greater degree than heretofore this ideal of individual rights and, with the advent of industrial capitalism, the ability of many individuals besides members of the landholding class to affect the order of society and the condition and appearance of their surroundings. Two towering late eighteenth-century figures who were contemporaries of <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name>, <name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name> and <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>, stood squarely in the currents of societal transition.

His influence in this area, however, was less as a designer than as a shaper of the cultural matrix within which the associative potential of nature was directed toward sentimental ends and landscape employed as a theater to enrapture the human mind.</p><p>His first novel, <title><hi rend="italic">Die Leiden des jungen Werthers</hi></title> (<title>The Sorrows of Young Werther</title>, <date when="1774">1774</date>), had an even more profound effect on his contemporaries than had <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name>'s immensely popular <title><hi rend="italic">Julie, on la Nouvelle H&#x00E9;lo&#x00EF;se</hi></title> when published a few years earlier. <title><hi rend="italic">Werther</hi></title> turned <name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name> overnight into a figure of international renown, and served as a catalyst for the new <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> (Storm and Stress) literary movement, which emphasized the validity of human emotion, impulse, instinct, intuition, and feeling.

Against <name type="pname" key="7170">Herder</name>'s Nordic wildness, <name type="pname" key="7010">Goethe</name>'s intellect sustained a countervailing tendency toward classicism.

This theatrical event was usually accomplished at night by pumping fire and smoke out of its crater while pouring water over the lip of the cone into which were set pieces of red-tinted glass illumined from the inside. The eerie glow of the reddish light beneath the tumbling water thus gave the impression of molten lava.</p><p>Contemporary philosophy provides a key to our understanding of the appeal of this and other similar tricks.

In <date when="1762">1762</date>, the Scottish theoretician <name type="pname" key="7178">Henry Home, Lord Kames</name> (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782">1782</date>) published his <title><hi rend="italic">Elements of Criticism</hi></title>, which treated gardening as a branch of the fine arts. According to <name type="pname" key="7178">Kames</name>, through the consideration of the specific sentimental values adhering to particular scenes and their arrangement within the landscape, designers could make the garden a source of emotional inspiration.</p><p>The writings of <name type="pname" key="7179">Christian Lorenz Hirschfeld</name> (<date when="1742">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">1792</date>), the Danish professor of aesthetics at <name type="place">Kiel University</name> in <name type="place">Schleswig-Holstein</name>, were also important to the development of the sentimentalist garden and to the course of landscape design in <name type="place">Germany</name>. Between <date when="1779">1779</date> and <date when="1785">1785</date>, he produced his five-volume <title><hi rend="italic">Theorie der Gartenkunst</hi></title> (<title>Theory of Garden Art</title>). Published simultaneously in German and French, this work attempted to explicate the evolution of landscape design while articulating a specifically German point of view toward it. <name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name> saw prehistoric antiquity as a time of felicity and oneness with nature. Subsequently, although the ancient Greeks were not garden designers, the manner in which their temples were situated in nature illustrates the harmony that existed between human beings and landscape in antiquity. <name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name> valued the virtues of the villa tradition of republican <name type="place">Rome</name>, with its fruitful husbandry combined with scholarly leisure, and he lamented its degeneration, as illustrated by the excessive grandeur and too lavish use of ornament in the gardens of imperial <name type="place">Rome</name>. Similarly, he held that the aggrandizement of the garden by <name type="pname" key="7014">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his followers was inimical to the happiness of the individual, for the French gardens, intended primarily as social settings, defeated the need of the individual to disengage from society for self-renewal and self-discovery in nature.</p><p>The English garden, in <name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name>'s opinion, thus offered a positive antidote to the French-style gardens that then prevailed in the Gennan principalities because the English garden was more conducive to reflection and provided a relaxed setting for personal spontaneity and simple, unaffected behavior. He saw the garden as a zone of mediation between art and nature, society and solitude, a prescriptive force for entering a state of civilized innocence and socialized freedom.</p><p>Underlying <name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name>'s work was another motive, that of nationalism. Whereas in <name type="place">England</name> the nationalism espoused by Whig liberals found direct <hi rend="italic">political</hi> expression (as well as symbolic expression in the garden), in <name type="place">Germany</name>, which was fragmented into principalities, the forging of national identity was necessarily through <hi rend="italic">culture</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Volk</hi>, the German people, were sustained by a venerable racial mythology, which was later dramatized in the operas of the nineteenth-century composer <name type="pname" key="7180">Richard Wagner</name>. German utopianism, as found in <name type="pname" key="7181">Friedrich Schiller</name>'s poem <title>"An die Freude"</title> (<date when="1785">1785</date>) and <name type="pname" key="7182">Ludwig van Beethoven</name>'s <title>Ninth Symphony</title> (<date when="1824">1824</date>), was infused with joy in nature, and this joy in nature&#x2014;the nature of dark forests and great rivers and green fields&#x2014;could help to form a new national character, one that in <name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name>'s view should be tempered with art. Affect&#x2014;feeling and emotion as opposed to cognition and reason&#x2014;was for him the guiding principle in garden design. Taste, a prized eighteenth-century virtue, had a moral dimension. In the same way as the ancient Greeks had both humanized and deified the larger landscape with their significantly sited temples and shrines, the contemporary German garden designer could uplift the spirit through the embellished natural landscape. The viewer could then create his own mental garden of noble associations and lofty ideals.</p><p><name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name>'s "Gennan" garden style provided the soil in which to cultivate the seeds of nationalism and regional pride. Patriotism and community spirit were to be instilled through "portraits of those men &#x2026; to whom we owe enlightenment, freedom, prosperity, pleasure."<ref target="#CH7-n56"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">56</hi></hi></ref> Classical temples, even devoid of any contemporary reference, would give the landscape "useful, instructive truth," but those dedicated to Peace, Love, or some similar desideratum, or to a particular individual's valor or contribution to humanity, would be even more desirable. The "borrowed scenery" of village church spires and other distant views would remind onlookers of the reciprocal relationship between nature and humanity and of the garden's place in the larger realm of society. Real heroes were to be preferred to mythological ones, and vernacular, rather than classical, inscriptions were recommended. <name type="pname" key="7179">Hirschfeld</name> is the father of the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi>, in which monuments commemorating a shared history and common cultural values fostered national identity.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> was intended as a place where people of all classes could congregate in an atmosphere that combined the cultural influence of architectural features, statues, and inscriptions with the beauty of nature.

He saw the necessity for certain modifications to the sentimentalist garden ideal in such public spaces as these. In the interests of accommodating crowds of promenaders and of increasing security, he recommended broad straight paths in some areas rather than winding, irregular ones.

Written in the wake of the French and American Revolutions, <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s poetry is one of affirmation in which egalitarianism is eagerly endorsed, both politically and in terms of the rights of the human mind (<hi rend="italic">all</hi> human minds) to gain access to emotion and experience. For <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>, the human heart is the common property of humanity, and the poet's task is to reveal, through imagination and language, images and ideas that will cause people to exercise this emotional birthright.</p><p>Simplicity, purity of response, and the innocent wonder of childhood are more important to <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> than elegant expression and enlightened discourse. Na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9; has its own profundity, and <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> is all. Nature unadorned, shorn of ornament and allusion, is capable of inspiring the loftiest thoughts. The rainbow, much cherished by <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> as a symbol, stands for our covenant with nature, a covenant in which our own infinitely renewable imaginative resources are assured by nature's own numinous being.</p><p>He knows that there is pathos in the yearning for unity and wholeness, as the moments in which one experiences a sense of divine totality are elusive and transitory. Yet <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> finds in our wonderment in the face of nature and in the contentment afforded by "spots of time"&#x2014;the renewal of self through stored recollections of sublimity&#x2014;the apparatus of faith. His poem <title><hi rend="italic">Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey</hi></title>, composed on <date when="1798-07-13">July 13, 1798</date>, while revisiting the "sylvan Wye" with its picturesque scenery and poetic ruins&#x2014;the scenery popularized by <name type="pname" key="7082">Gilpin</name>&#x2014;is an embodiment of the faith whereby the human mind can achieve, not through reason, but by some innate and incomprehensible power<q><lg><l>&#x2014;that serene and blessed mood</l><l>In which affections gently lead us on,</l><l>Until, the breath of this corporeal frame</l><l>And even the motion of our human blood</l><l>Almost suspended, we are laid asleep</l><l>In body and become a living soul,</l><l>While, with an eye made quiet by the power</l><l>Of harmony and the deep power of joy,</l><l>We see into the life of things &#x2026;<ref target="#CH7-n61"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">61</hi></hi></ref></l></lg></q></p><p><name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> did not need temples, statues, or inscriptions to excite this mood. His poetry gives sanction to landscapes without any associations other than those of one's own recollected experiences of nature rapturously imbibed in youth:<q><lg><l>The sounding cataract</l><l>Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,</l><l>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</l><l>Their colours and their forms, were then to me</l><l>An appetite: a feeling and a love,</l><l>That had no need of a remoter charm,</l><l>By thought supplied, or any interest</l><l>Unborrowed from the eye.<ref target="#CH7-n62"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">62</hi></hi></ref></l></lg></q></p><p>The same scenes of natural unadorned landscape can serve as a source of wisdom in maturity when<q><lg><l>&#x2026; That time is past,</l><l>And all its aching joys are now no more,</l><l>And all its dizzy raptures. &#x2026;</l><l>&#x2026; For I have learned</l><l>To look on Nature not as in the hour</l><pb n="278"/><pb n="278" type="orig"/><l>Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</l><l>The still, sad music of humanity,</l><l>Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power</l><l>To chasten and subdue.<ref target="#CH7-n63"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">63</hi></hi></ref></l></lg></q></p><p>Nature is thus for <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> a powerful moral force, teacher, and guide. In <name type="pname" key="7002">Locke</name>'s philosophy, the senses gave rise to ideas; in <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s Romantic vision, the transaction that occurs between the human mind and nature awakens a spiritual sense, and this engenders feelings of reverence and awe. In <title>"The Ascent of Snowdon,"</title> with which he concludes <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>, <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> narrates an epiphany:<q><lg><l>A meditation rose in me that night</l><l>Upon the lonely Mountain when the scene</l><l>Had passed away, and it appeared to me</l><l>The perfect image of a mighty Mind,</l><l>Of one that feeds upon infinity,</l><l>That is exalted by an underpresence,</l><l>The sense of God, or whatsoe'er is dim</l><l>Or vast in its own being. &#x2026;<ref target="#CH7-n64"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">64</hi></hi></ref></l></lg></q></p><p>With this spiritual legacy, it is understandable that Romanticism became a dominant cultural force in the nineteenth century.

His is a revolutionary voice championing common humanity. He sings the heroes heretofore unsung; common folk, not legendary heroes, populate his poems. <title>"The Old Cumberland Beggar,"</title> <title>"The Idle Shepherd Boys,"</title> <title>"The Sailor's Mother,"</title> and <title>"The Tinker"</title> exist amid the picturesqueness of <title>"The Ruined Cottage,"</title> <title>"HartLeap Well,"</title> and <title>"The Waterfall and the Eglantine."</title> For <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>, beauty lies not in a some remote Golden Age, but is "a living Presence of the earth." In <title>"Home at Grasmere"</title> (<title>"The Recluse"</title>) he queries:<q><lg><l>&#x2026; Paradise, and groves</l><l>Elysian, fortunate islands, fields like those of old</l><l>In the deep ocean, wherefore should they be</l><l>A History, or but a dream, when minds</l><l>Once wedded to this outward frame of things,</l><l>In love, find these the growth of common day?<ref target="#CH7-n65"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">65</hi></hi></ref></l></lg></q></p><p>For him, the union of mind and universe is a boundless one; it implies individuation and seeks the sublime in the quotidian. Court and city were corrupt institutions in <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s opinion, the breeding grounds of inequality and misery. It is in the haunts of nature that the mind can itself become a kind of paradise, the place where idealized moral beings like <name type="pname" key="7006">Rousseau</name>'s citizen of <name type="place">Geneva</name> or <name type="pname" key="7009">Jefferson</name>'s yeoman farmer can experience joy and know self-worth. Solitude was for him a condition to be prized, a necessary means of developing the spiritual within oneself.</p><figure xml:id="fig-327"><graphic url="CH7_052.jpg"/></figure><p>Although he did not align himself in the Picturesque controversy that had recently raged between <name type="pname" key="7090">Knight</name>, <name type="pname" key="7091">Price</name>, and <name type="pname" key="7093">Repton</name>, he held definite views regarding landscape design, as was evident at <name type="place" subtype="site">Dove Cottage</name> and <name type="place" subtype="site">Rhydal Mount</name>, his <name type="place">Lake District</name> villa near <name type="place">Grasmere</name>, where his own gardens displayed his fine color sense and knowledge of botany (fig. 7.50). Rustic summerhouses, rock walls encrusted with moss and covered with vines, and steps with flowers squeezing through the paving stones were to be found in both. In <date when="1806">1806</date>, at the request of his friends, <name type="pname" key="7193">Sir George and Lady Beaumont</name>, he sketched a plan that would convert an abandoned quarry at their country seat, <name type="place" subtype="site">Coleorton Hall</name>, <name type="place">Leicestershire</name>, into a one-acre winter<pb n="279"/><pb n="279" type="orig"/>garden planted with evergreen shrubs, cypresses, and firs. A pool at the quarry's edge reflected its craggy side walls and the tall spires of the conifers. A single basin for goldfish set in a lawn spangled with a few wildflowers completed <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s design of this intimate and secluded retreat where one could experience the joys of solitude.</p><p>Glimpses of two ivy-clad cottages were allowed to intrude upon this Romantic scene, for <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name> subscribed to the utilitarianism that would increasingly dominate nineteenth-century culture, believing that these signs of productive husbandry were compatible with the poetic mood of his landscape composition. He felt that the landscape designer should respect the "sentiment of the place," the term he substituted for <name type="pname" key="7001">Pope</name>'s "Genius of the Place." Just as he banished the old classical deities of aristocratic humanism from his poetry, so, too, he wanted in the designed landscape no allusions other than those inherent in natural and rural scenery. He wished to raise aesthetics above the dictates of taste to the realm where the mind, informed by culture, could engage actively and imaginatively with landscape in all its aspects, including the vernacular.</p><p>The revolutionary era that informed <name type="pname" key="7011">Wordsworth</name>'s intellect and to which he gave voice had important consequences for landscape design. Henceforth, Bacchus and Pan would absent themselves from the garden. With them, too, would disappear an international vocabulary of landscape ornament as cosmopolitan culture gave way to the ideals of Romantic nationalism. Thus, in an extension of the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> concept, folk heroes and other emblems of a political and secular order would take the place of antique divinities.</p><p>In the dawning Industrial Age, many people left the villages that were at last being considered picturesque adornments to the country seat, aggregating in cities larger than any built before. It would henceforth be the task of democratic humanitarianism to ameliorate the conditions of urban life through the institution of the public park, the Romantic landscape of the common man. But before examining the further manifestations of Romanticism in nineteenth-century landscape design and the corresponding continuation and modification of the picturesque as a viable style for private pleasure grounds and public parks alike, it is necessary to look at two other approaches to the spiritual in nature, those of <name type="place">China</name> and <name type="place">Japan</name>. As we have seen, the taste for Rococo <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi> in the eighteenth century brought but a facile interpretation of Chinese garden style into Western currency. We must therefore ask the question: What is the nature of Chinese and Japanese landscape design?</p></div><div type="subsection"><head><hi rend="bold"><hi rend="smallcaps">Notes for Chapter Seven</hi></hi></head>
