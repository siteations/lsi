<p><hi rend="bold">T</hi>he seventeenth century saw the birth of scientific modernism in Western culture. A probing inquiry into the nature of nature, the growing reliance on inductive reasoning, and a new confidence based upon a continuously expanding understanding of the uni-<lb/>
verse was paralleled in landscape design by the extension of axes beyond the boundaries of the garden. The universe and all nature were now perceived in dimensions far grander and more indeter-<lb/>
minate than those imagined by the Christian theologians and Aris-<lb/>
totelian scholastics of the Middle Ages, or even by the Renaissance humanists whose curiosity and methods of inquiry helped build a bridge between the medieval and modern worldviews.</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter Five, confidence in human power and growing dominion over nature as well as celebration of the intel-<lb/>
ligible order of nature revealed by science infused the work of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and other seventeenth-century landscape designers. They had by this time completely abandoned the imagery inherent in the <hi rend="italic">hortus conclusus</hi>, the garden as a sanctified precinct set apart from the world at large. Instead, they laid out long axes that stretched to the horizon and built monuments that celebrated human author-<lb/>
ity and achievement.</p>
<p>The increased power that human beings perceived themselves to hold over their own destiny grew in tandem with the power of nation-states and the institutionalization of monarchical govern-<lb/>
ment. <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> created at <name type="place">Versailles</name> the ultimate symbol of auto-<lb/>
cratic rule, and the value of that landscape in bolstering a royal reputation was not lost upon the other princes of <name type="place">Europe</name>. The growing power of states necessitated a concomitant increase in the dignity and monumentality of capital cities, which now expanded their role in manifesting national cultural identity. The extension and protection of state boundaries through new developments in military engineering, first apparent in <name type="place">France</name> under <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, ren-<lb/>
dered old city walls obsolete and made possible an expansion of urban territory that paralleled the outward extension of the gar-<lb/>
den's axes. The axial plan of <name type="place">Versailles</name> was applied to parts of the layout and redevelopment of the city itself as well as to the con-<lb/>
struction of many <name type="place">Versailles</name>-inspired princely gardens.</p>
<p>The landscape formulas of French classicism thus provided an international style applicable to both the design of gardens and the building of cities, especially capitals. Although French-inspired, this style was never completely severed from its Italian roots, and the design influence of that country remained a potent one. <name type="place">Italy</name>, with its heritage of antique architecture and artifacts, was the prin-<lb/>
cipal destination of travelers on the Grand Tour in the eighteenth century. Italian artists continued to find employment abroad in the construction of palaces, gardens, and theaters as well as in the decoration of public places with fountains and monuments. Indeed, it was in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century city plan-<lb/>
ning that the decorative motifs and theatrical grandeur of the Ital-<lb/>
ian Baroque style were combined with the geometries of French authoritarian classicism to create a new international vocabulary of urban design.</p>
<p>Where there was sufficient wealth and centralized govern-<lb/>
mental control to implement grand urban designs, the monumental cityscape of radiating axes emerged, as in Karlsruhe, <name type="place">Germany</name>. Streets were no longer conceived as residual spaces between build-<lb/>
ings but instead were consciously composed perspectives like those found in the theater. The city itself became a giant stage for the pageantry of church and state, with tree-lined streets punctuated by ceremonial arches. Some of these were temporary construc-<lb/>
tions for special occasions; others were permanent commemora-<lb/>
tions. Heroic sculptures formed the legendary <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> of the urban scene. Along with columns and obelisks, they acted as focal points, terminating vistas. In this fashion, the modern city was created, a city with broad avenues suitable for regimented and rapid movement and with public places enlivened by appropriate sym-<lb/>
bols of national and local culture.</p>

<p>The flow of ideas depends upon means of commu-<lb/>
nication. Since antiquity, direct observation of foreign scenes by travelers had carried innovations in archi-<lb/>
tecture and landscape design to new places. But begin-<lb/>
ning in the sixteenth century, the growth of printing and the publication of books and albums of engrav-<lb/>
ings were responsible for the rapid spread of land-<lb/>
scape design concepts. Architects, sculptors, and hydraulic engineers still responded to commissions from princes. But by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, stylistic imitation became far easier because engravings served not only as proud records of exist-<lb/>
ing gardens but also as examples from which prospec-<lb/>
tive garden makers derived inspiration.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Books and Prints</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Leon Battista Alberti</name>'s <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>, originally published around <date when="1450">1450</date>, and <name type="pname">Francesco Colonna</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Hyp-<lb/>
nerotomachia Poliphili</hi> of <date when="1499">1499</date>, were translated into French in the mid-sixteenth century, and these books retained a broad influence until well into the seven-<lb/>
teenth century. While they could be mined for pro-<lb/>
totypical classical details, neither provided engraved plans of entire gardens. Similarly, <name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name>'s <hi rend="italic">I quattro libri dell'architettura</hi> of <date when="1570">1570</date>, was, like <name type="pname">Alberti</name>'s work, primarily a book of architectural instruction rather than an illustrated catalog of designs.<ref target="#CH6-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">1</hi></hi></ref> Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, a French architect, published several books of his own engravings of designs for knot designs, fountains, and garden pavilions. His two-<lb/>
volume work, <hi rend="italic">Les plus excellents bastiments de <name type="place">France</name></hi> (<date when="1576">1576</date> and <date when="1579">1579</date>), recorded and promoted the French Renaissance garden style.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Trait&#x00E9; du jardinage</hi> of <name type="pname">Jacques Boyceau</name> (<date when="1638">1638</date>) and <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Le Jardin de plaisir</hi> (<date when="1651">1651</date>), pioneered how-to books on the layout of ornamen-<lb/>
tal pleasure gardens. <name type="pname">Jean-Baptiste</name> de la Quintinye's <hi rend="italic">Instruction pour les jardins fruitiers et potagers</hi> (<date when="1690">1690</date>) was based on the author's experience as the head gardener of the <hi rend="italic">potager</hi>, or kitchen garden, at <name type="place">Versailles</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n2"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">2</hi></hi></ref> This book, which carried the horticultural treatise to a new level of science, contained detailed instructions on planting, pruning, and espaliering of fruit trees and the cultivation of vegetables. As valuable as these texts were, they could not compensate for the serious lack of a text and illustrations detailing the achievements of <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> over half a century.</p>
<p>In <date when="1709">1709</date>, the publisher <name type="pname">Pierre Mariette</name> remedied this situation when he brought out <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pra-<lb/>
tique du jardinage</hi> by <name type="pname">Antoine-Joseph Dezallier d'Ar-<lb/>
genville</name> (<date when="1680">1680</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765">1765</date>), which, translated into three languages and running to eleven editions, dissemi-<lb/>
nated the French seventeenth-century style to an international audience (fig. 6.1). <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s book was written as a manual for aristocrats wishing to lay out <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>-style gardens on plots ranging from 3 to 60 acres. In addition to furnishing numerous <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bosquet</hi> patterns, it articulates four maxims that cod-<lb/>
ify the underlying principles of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s approach.</p>

<figDesc>6.1. An example of the illustrations from <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la pratique du jardinage</hi> by <name type="pname">A.-J. Dezallier d'Argenville</name>. As many of the book's engraved plates were drawn by <name type="pname">Alexandre Le Blond</name> (<date when="1679">1679</date>&#x2013;<date when="1719">1719</date>), an architect and follower of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> who also contributed several <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs to this work, the title page of the English editions published by <name type="pname">John Johns</name> bears <name type="pname">Le Blond</name>'s name as author; this has confused some garden historians in the past.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>First, a garden designer should make art yield to nature. <name type="pname">Dezallier</name> did not mean by this what the English later would mean, that a garden should appear unstudied, an integral part of the larger natu-<lb/>
ral scene, but rather that topographic and other char-<lb/>
acteristics of the site should be considered carefully. Further, ostentatious display of wealth through exces-<lb/>
sive ornament should be abandoned in favor of sim-<lb/>
ple steps, turf banks, ramps, natural arbors, and hedges without trellises.</p>
<p>Nor did giving way to nature mean to <name type="pname">Dezallier</name> abandoning geometrical design and eliminating topi-<lb/>
ary and other regimented horticultural effects. Rather, for him it consisted of eradicating all Renaissance intricacy, which now appeared as mere fussiness, and clarifying and unifying all garden parts into a design that respected both the natural site conditions and the patron's purse. The French seventeenth-century gar-<lb/>
den had already chastened the intricacies of Renais-<lb/>
sance style, but it was still elaborately ornamental and therefore exceedingly labor-intensive. Further
<pb n="196"/>
<pb n="196" type="orig"/>
simplification was needed if it was to be developed on a broad scale by aristocrats who did not possess the same resources as royalty.</p>
<p>Second, according to <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>, a designer should be careful never to cloud and darken gardens by making them dull and gloomy with thickets and excessive ground cover. He found openness desirable, especially around a building, inasmuch as a building needs its own envelope of space. But, as a third prin-<lb/>
ciple, he enjoined the designer from making the gar-<lb/>
den <hi rend="italic">too</hi> open. He recommended "contrariety and change," a happy balance between openness and enclosure and, through the arrangement of sight lines, the possibility of mystery and surprise. As a final cardinal rule, the designer should manipulate the ter-<lb/>
rain and planting so as to conceal the garden's bound-<lb/>
aries, thus making it appear larger than its actual size.<ref target="#CH6-n3"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">3</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The second part of <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s book contains practical information on transcribing geometrical fig-<lb/>
ures onto the ground plane as well as on methods of digging and dressing the ground, techniques for build-<lb/>
ing terraces and stairs, and instructions for laying out <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs, planting trees, and building basins and fountains. Widely read, <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et pratique du jardi-<lb/>
nage</hi> was instrumental in spreading French taste throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>. The noted architect <name type="pname">Nicodemus Tessin</name> the Younger (<date when="1654">1654</date>&#x2013;<date when="1728">1728</date>), who served the Swedish court, copied two sections of this important text verbatim for the instruction of his son, adding such comments as he found necessary to make it relevant to climatic and topographical conditions in <name type="place">Stockholm</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Dezallier</name> wrote his book at the same time that <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> was founding his new capital on the Neva and after the Holy Roman Empire had virtually dissolved into many Germanic principalities. Court architecture was experiencing its heyday, and there were many opportunities for applying <name type="pname">Dezallier</name>'s land-<lb/>
scape design precepts to the construction of princely gardens. From one perspective <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et pratique du jardinage</hi> could be seen as a codification of the prin-<lb/>
ciples of French seventeenth-century landscape design at the very moment it was going out of fashion, par-<lb/>
ticularly in <name type="place">England</name> and soon in <name type="place">France</name> itself. From another point of view, however, it provided a useful and popular guide for those who wanted to continue an important aspect of royal and aristocratic tradition almost until the time of the French Revolution. Con-<lb/>
sequently, its results are evident in many courtly gar-<lb/>
dens of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>In another important pattern book, <hi rend="italic">De la distri-<lb/>
bution des maisons de plaisance</hi> (<date when="1737">1737</date>) by <name type="pname">Jacques-<lb/>
-Fran&#x00E7;ois Blondel</name>, one finds architectural, landscape, and interior plans and elevations in the classical style. <name type="pname">Blondel</name>'s garden plans display axial symmetry and other hallmarks of that style and include numerous illustrations of garden ornament: treillage, fountains, belvederes, embroidered <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, grillwork, urns, tro-<lb/>
phies, sphinxes, herms, and more. His designs demon-<lb/>
strate how aristocrats without royal resources at their command can achieve on a modest scale effects simi-<lb/>
lar to those at <name type="place">Versailles</name>. Actually, <name type="pname">Blondel</name> stands at the juncture of what is often referred to as the French Classical style and that of the French Picturesque. In his <hi rend="italic">Cours d'architecture</hi> (<date when="1773">1773</date>), he praises the beauties to be found in views of simple nature outside the gar-<lb/>
den bounds, and this, along with the Rococo delicacy of his designs, indicates the burgeoning picturesque taste and interest in pastoral themes.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Dissemination of French Landscape Style</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">Dezallier</name> was well aware of the economies necessary if the French seventeenth-century style were to sur-<lb/>
vive. His 3- and 6-acre gardens cleverly give an illusion of grandeur within a small compass, and he warns his readers that elaborate ornament demands a royal purse. Yet there were royal purses still to be found, as well as cheap labor for massive construction works.</p>
<p>Late in the reign of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> and for decades thereafter, the resident court and the court city became the pattern throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>, from Hamp-<lb/>
ton Court in <name type="place">England</name> under <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> (ruled <date when="1689">1689</date>&#x2013;<date when="1702">1702</date>) to <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> in <name type="place">Russia</name>, founded by <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> (<date when="1682">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1725">1725</date>) in <date when="1703">1703</date>, to <name type="place">Drottningholm</name> in <name type="place">Stockholm</name>, commissioned by the dowager queen <name type="pname">Hedvig Leonora</name> and built between <date when="1680">1680</date> and <date when="1700">1700</date>, to the <name type="pname">Buen Retiro</name> in <name type="place">Madrid</name>, created during the reign of <name type="place">Philip IV</name> (ruled <date when="1621">1621</date>&#x2013;<date when="1665">1665</date>). <name type="place">Central Europe</name> offered many opportunities for absolute rule and its princely trappings. The Peace of Westphalia of <date when="1648">1648</date> conclud-<lb/>
ing the Thirty Years' War had brought about the col-<lb/>
lapse of the Holy Roman Empire and the weakening of Hapsburg rule along with the concomitant empow-<lb/>
erment of many German princes. As these wealthy men assumed an almost fully sovereign status, they inevitably sought to aggrandize their electorates, king-<lb/>
doms, principalities, and dukedoms with palace gar-<lb/>
dens built according to French taste, some of which were actual copies of French designs.</p>
<p>There were, nevertheless, essential cultural and physical differences from country to country, which accounted for various vernacular design dialects in the language of the new international-style garden. A closer examination of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> and <name type="place">England</name> in particular shows versions of the French theme at a time of self-conscious nationalism. Less secure in their boundaries than either the English or the French, German principalities showed the influence of new developments in military design in their treatment of the French landscape model.</p>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">The <name type="place">Netherlands</name></hi></head>
<p>The Dutch did not create a wholly indigenous style but instead adapted the Renaissance landscape idiom developed elsewhere to their country's geography of canalized land reclamation and its strong tradition of urban bourgeois prosperity. Gradually recognized as a nation in its own right after the expulsion of Span-<lb/>
ish rule in the seventeenth century, the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> exhibited the prosperity of its economic ruling class in many private gardens. Even monarchical ambi-<lb/>
tions were tempered by the circumstances of topog-<lb/>
raphy and the pragmatic values of a mercantile nation, making the Dutch and Anglo-Dutch gardens of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> more intimate in scale, more compartmentalized, and less grandly unified than their French prototypes.</p>
<p>The Dutch designed compact gardens and sub-<lb/>
stituted variety and intricacy for broad effects. The influence of the Mannerist designer and publisher of numerous architectural pattern books, <name type="pname">Hans Vrede-<lb/>
man de Vries</name> (<date when="1527">1527</date>&#x2013;<date when="1606">1606</date>), whose <hi rend="italic">Hortorum viridario-<lb/>
rumque elegantes et multiplicis formae</hi> of <date when="1583">1583</date> set the tone in this regard, was long-lasting. The engravings in this influential pattern book show many variations on the theme of the urban or suburban garden: gallery-surrounded <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> of <hi rend="italic">pi&#x00E8;ces coup&#x00E9;es</hi> (grass cutwork) divided by <hi rend="italic">berceaux</hi> (arched trellises) and accented with topiary and fountains (figs. 6.2a and 6.2b). For de Vries, garden enlargement was additive, consisting of multiplied design units, or garden rooms, rather than the integrated expansion of the garden's parts to a new design scale. Like other design-<lb/>
ers from the Renaissance onward, he had enthusias-<lb/>
tically studied the treatise of the ancient Roman architectural theorist <name type="pname">Vitruvius Pollio</name> (active 46&#x2013;30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi>). He was also familiar with <hi rend="italic">Tutte l'opere d'ar-<lb/>
chitettura</hi> by the Renaissance theorist <name type="pname">Sebastiano Ser-<lb/>
lio</name> (<date when="1475">1475</date>&#x2013;<date when="1554">1554</date>). His own schemes, rendered with the exaggerated perspective characteristic of Mannerism, contain various forms derived from ancient and Renaissance architecture, such as obelisks and pyra-<lb/>
mids. Although de Vries gave his pattern gardens the names of the classical orders codified by <name type="pname">Serlio</name>, the terms&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Doric</hi> for rectilinear geometric beds and <hi rend="italic">Ionic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Corinthian</hi> for those of circular and labyrinthine construction&#x2014;are more imaginative than apt.</p>

<p>An exuberant use of topiary and a native taste for genre subjects in garden statuary characterized the many gardens that lined the banks of suburban rivers and canals, providing weekend retreats for wealthy merchants. These gardens afforded a two-<lb/>
way spectacle, since they provided an unfolding scene of great interest to boat passengers and, being fur-<lb/>
nished with pavilions and platforms overlooking the water, offered their owners the pleasure of observing the water parade.</p>
<p>Although the Dutch appropriated the seven-<lb/>
teenth-century French landscape style, they reduced its grandeur and scale to suit the topography and social expectations of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>. We see this in the now impeccably restored royal gardens of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> in the eastern part of the country, the Veluwe, a nonarable rolling landscape of low-growing brush and heather. This is excellent country for the pursuit of game, and like <name type="place">Versailles</name>, <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> had its origin as a hunting lodge. As Stadholder of Gelderland after <date when="1672">1672</date>, <name type="pname">Prince William III</name> of Orange had hunting rights to the Veluwe. Being a passionate sportsman, he pur-<lb/>
chased the old castle of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> with the notion of building a more elegant and modern hunting estab-<lb/>
lishment elsewhere on the property.</p>
<p>Work began in <date when="1686">1686</date> under the supervision of the Dutch architect <name type="pname">Jacob Roman</name> (<date when="1640">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1716">1716</date>) accord-<lb/>
ing to designs thought to have been developed by the Academy of Architecture in <name type="place">Paris</name>. Simultaneously, following the revocation of the <date when="1685">1685</date> Edict of Nantes, the <name type="pname">French Huguenot</name> designer <name type="pname">Daniel Marot</name> (<date when="1661">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752">1752</date>) moved to the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, and he was soon employed as the principal designer of the new palace's interiors and gardens. This fact accounts for the remarkable decorative unity between the two, with <hi rend="italic">parterres de broderie</hi> echoing the arabesques of molded ceilings, damask wall coverings, and iron grillwork. Between <date when="1695">1695</date> and <date when="1699">1699</date>, subsequent to the corona-<lb/>
tion of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> as king and queen of <name type="place">England</name> in <date when="1689">1689</date>, their gardens at <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> were exten-<lb/>
sively remodeled by <name type="pname">Roman</name>, <name type="pname">Marot</name>, and <name type="pname">Romeyn de Hooghe</name> (<date when="1645">1645</date>&#x2013;<date when="1708">1708</date>) to make them suitable for enter-<lb/>
taining state visitors when the joint sovereigns were in residence in the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Het Loo</name> displays its debt to <name type="place">Versailles</name> in its strong central axis with ornamental <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> symmetrically arranged along it and its use of sculpture depicting classical subjects. But a closer look reveals important differences, the most pronounced being its relative modesty, intimacy of scale, sense of containment, and lack of transition between art and nature. Where <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name> virtually explodes into the surrounding space, <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> is strictly confined within its rectilinear enclos-<lb/>
ing walls like earlier gardens of the Renaissance. The principal axis of the Lower Garden extends beyond its boundary, but the twin arms of the curving colonnade at the far end of the Upper Garden hold it in a firm embrace, thereby vitiating its outward thrust (fig. 6.4). Nor has <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> major transverse axes like those that open <name type="place">Versailles</name> and Vaux-le-Vicomte to distant prospects of rural countryside.</p>
<p>The Lower Garden near the palace is laid out in square compartments as in a Renaissance garden, and this is also true of the King's Garden and Queen's Gar-<lb/>
den on either side of it (figs. 6.5, 6.6). The French and Dutch designers of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> employed none of the compensation for optical foreshortening one finds in <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s more sophisticated designs, but they relied instead on the simpler geometries of an earlier period. The pair of elaborate trellis arbors in the Queen's Garden are similar to those of Renaissance gardens.</p>
<p>Besides the containment of Baroque ornamen-<lb/>
tal elements within an enclosed orthogonal frame-<lb/>
work reminiscent of Renaissance gardens, the most significant difference between Dutch and French sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century gardens lies in the role played by the canal in each. At <name type="place">Versailles</name>, Chantilly, and elsewhere in <name type="place">France</name>, the canals that help drain the land are boldly scaled ornamental sheets of water used to create the principal axes of the garden. In the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, where
<pb n="199"/>
<pb n="199" type="orig"/>
much of the country lies below sea level, a ubiquitous functional canal system actually creates much of the land. This system divides the Dutch landscape into rec-<lb/>
tilinear units, so that canals form transportation arter-<lb/>
ies and also mark property boundaries. Although purely ornamental canals were constructed in some of the larger aristocratic gardens, these never assumed the same importance as the broad water axes of French gardens. At <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>, for instance, a pair of nar-<lb/>
row parallel canals divides the Upper Garden from the Lower Garden. These are bordered by tree-lined promenades similar to those flanking the canals of the countryside at large (fig. 6.7). In addition, because of the scarcity of stone, architectural cascades such as those at <name type="pname">Het Loo</name> were necessarily small in scale and the exception rather than the rule (fig. 6.8).</p>

<p>The French landscape tradition had only a brief life in <name type="place">England</name>, particularly after eighteenth-century Whig aristocrats, who represented the country's increasingly powerful antiroyalist commitment to par-<lb/>
liamentary government, rejected Gallic influence on the grounds that it symbolized monarchical abso-<lb/>
lutism. Nor did the Counter-Reformation assert its Baroque splendor there as it did in the European Catholic monarchies. The Renaissance literature of <name type="pname">Shakespeare</name> and <name type="pname">Bacon</name> is filled with images indicat-<lb/>
ing the delight in nature of a people blessed with a landscape already endowed with much gentle beauty. <name type="pname">Shakespeare</name>'s plays and poems are filled with pastoral images and scenes of sylvan revels, in which he men-<lb/>
tions numerous garden flowers and wildflowers. Bacon's essay "Of Gardens" (<date when="1625">1625</date>) points the way toward both the sensuous and the sensible in garden design. He lists all the flowers and fruits that provide horticultural pleasure at various seasons of the year, while disdaining knot gardens, which he character-<lb/>
izes as "toys" worthy only of a pastry chef.<ref target="#CH6-n4"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">4</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>The pastoral literature of antiquity also played an important role in the English version of the Renais-<lb/>
sance dialectic between art and nature. The vision of rural contentment conjured by <name type="pname">Virgil</name>, the most romantic of the ancient pastoralists, had an especially
<pb n="200"/>
<pb n="200" type="orig"/>
profound influence, inspiring poets and landscape designers alike. <name type="pname">Ovid</name> furnished a host of woodland deities with which to populate English groves. And not only the "saints" of <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>'s Commonwealth, but many royalists, too, found ancient role models in Horace, who equated industrious husbandry with republican virtue. The treatises of <name type="pname">Cato</name>, <name type="pname">Varro</name>, and <name type="pname">Columella</name> were mined for practical information on agricultural practices. For the gentry as well as the aristocracy, Pliny the Younger's vision of <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>, or intellectually productive exurban leisure, gave author-<lb/>
ity for the use of country houses and gardens as places to demonstrate an interest in both new and anti-<lb/>
quarian knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, late Renaissance architecture in <name type="place">Eng-<lb/>
land</name>, thanks to <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name> (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652">1652</date>), rested on the pure geometries of <name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name>'s classical style. Even in the more robust grandeur of <name type="pname">Jones</name>'s succes-<lb/>
sors&#x2014;<name type="pname">Christopher Wren</name> (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723">1723</date>), <name type="pname">Nicholas Hawksmoor</name> (<date when="1661">1661</date>&#x2013;<date when="1736">1736</date>), and <name type="pname">John Vanbrugh</name> (<date when="1664">1664</date>&#x2013;<date when="1726">1726</date>)&#x2014;English architecture shunned the abso-<lb/>
lutist overtones of the decoratively refined French style and avoided the flamboyance of the exuberantly ornamental Italian Baroque. This fact necessarily bore consequences for landscape design. <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s spare yet Olympian style was vigorously revived by <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name>'s circle in the eighteenth century, when architectural simplicity based upon ancient models gained even greater political connotations than in the seventeenth. The Palladian style helped place English landscape design upon an Italian foundation. Further, the scale of English gardens remained closer to the relatively intimate scale of Italian ones, and English topography provided more opportunities for terrac-<lb/>
ing in the Italian manner than did the plains of <name type="place">France</name> or the lowlands of <name type="place">Northern Europe</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n5"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">5</hi></hi></ref></p>

Engraving c. <date when="1632">1632</date>. The garden proper consisted of three principal divisions built around the central axis. Near the house this avenue was flanked with square compartments of <hi rend="italic">broderie</hi> overlooked by terraced walks. The middle section contained a pair of arbor-bracketed groves (counterparts of the French <hi rend="italic">berceaux</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi>) through which ran the Nadder. This stream was not canalized, as would have been the case in a French garden, but left to take a naturally irregular course traversing the symmetrical groves. At the far end, in front of <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name>'s fine architectural grotto, was a lawn divided by curving tree- and hedge-lined walks, in the center of which stood a bronze cast by <name type="pname">Hubert Le Sueur</name> of the antique sculpture known as the Borghese Gladiator. On either side of it were arbors for strolling on hot days.</figDesc>
</figure>
<p>The conflation of antiquarian interest with polit-<lb/>
ical values received a further boost from travel. Eng-<lb/>
lish aristocrats, already steeped in Latin literature, formed strong direct associations with <name type="place">Italy</name> in the sev-<lb/>
enteenth century, when taking the Grand Tour became practicable and fashionable. Thus, Italian gar-<lb/>
den influence unmediated by that of <name type="place">France</name> played a greater role in <name type="place">England</name> than on the Continent. Sev-<lb/>
eral garden patrons attempted to recapture the idyl-<lb/>
lic spirit of the ancient gardens of literature, as well as to imitate the poetic associations found in Italian Renaissance gardens such as that of the Villa d'Este through the use of statuary and grottoes in axial ter-<lb/>
raced compositions.</p>
<p>These English nobles had a strong interest in scientific discovery. This helps account for their fas-<lb/>
cination with the technological aspects of garden hydrology as embodied in the ingenious automata&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">giocchi d'acqua</hi>&#x2014;they had seen in Italian gardens. A popular treatise by <name type="pname">Salomon de Caus</name> (c. <date when="1577">1577</date>&#x2013;<date when="1626">1626</date>), <hi rend="italic">Les Raisons des forces mouvantes</hi> (<date when="1615">1615</date>), made the mechanics of automata familiar to them. De Caus, a French Huguenot, had spent three years in <name type="place">Italy</name> as a young man and, upon coming to <name type="pname">James I</name>'s court in <date when="1610">1610</date>, introduced waterworks technology, terracing, and other Italian gardening concepts. The English aristocratic mania for grotto construction reflected a desire to emulate the grottoes of Italian gardens and to establish the grotto's status as a place for sci-<lb/>
entific study.<ref target="#CH6-n6"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">6</hi></hi></ref> Like the popular contemporary cabi-<lb/>
nets of curiosities, these grottoes contained mineral and rock specimens as well as collections of marine shells. They also served as laboratories for a variety of experiments combining hydraulic machinery with natural forces.</p>
<p>Garden prospects, including the scenery beyond the garden boundaries, served the same function as perspective backdrops in the theater. "Prospect" was an early and often-cited value in the development of the English garden. By evoking ancient Roman forms and including real British ruins&#x2014;mostly those of old monasteries, for which there was much antiquarian enthusiasm&#x2014;these English gardens became mem-<lb/>
ory theaters and palimpsests of an ennobled past. Stages for social intercourse and entertainment, they also became arenas of philosophical contemplation and dramatic meditation upon national and family history. At <name type="pname">Wilton</name> and other seventeenth-century gar-<lb/>
dens, the prospects contained elements of association with imperial <name type="place">Rome</name>. In addition, the notion that the
<pb n="201"/>
<pb n="201" type="orig"/>
ruins of medieval <name type="place">Britain</name> could express <name type="place">England</name>'s own antique greatness was gaining currency.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Isaac de Caus</name> (fl. <date when="1612">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1655">1655</date>), the son or nephew of Salomon de Caus, collaborated with <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name> on the design of the most famous garden in <name type="place">England</name> in its day, that of <name type="pname">Wilton House</name> (fig. 6.9). The visitor to <name type="pname">Wilton</name> today is scarcely aware of the buried splen-<lb/>
dor of the original garden because it has been revised several times over the years, most notably during the eighteenth century by the ninth Earl of Pembroke. His Palladian bridge of <date when="1737">1737</date> and towering cedars remain as relics of the eighteenth century, but they are only the most visible parts of the palimpsest. There are the remains of a splendid grotto (now a schoolhouse) and other scattered fragments of the garden that was the pride of <name type="pname">Philip Herbert</name>, fourth earl of Pembroke, in the <date when="1630">1630</date>s. Then, <name type="pname">Wilton</name>'s greatly admired garden offered hospitality to the fashionable and learned world.</p>
<p>The earl's gardeners laid out a symmetrical land-<lb/>
scape along a central axis leading to <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name>'s por-<lb/>
ticoed structure and beyond to a green amphitheater and wooded grove. There the prospect culminated in a Roman-style triumphal arch topped by an eques-<lb/>
trian statue. Behind the loggia of <name type="pname">Jones</name>'s structure, which was decorated with marble bas-reliefs and may have served as a banqueting chamber, and beneath the terrace connecting the garden with the wooded slope beyond, was an extraordinary three-chambered grotto, a particular source of <name type="pname">Wilton</name>'s fame.</p>
<p>Within it, automata, mechanically propelled waterworks, delighted the earl's guests. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s influence later demystified grottoes and made such mechanical marvels as the ones <name type="pname">Isaac de Caus</name> installed at <name type="pname">Wilton</name> seem puerile. But in early-seventeenth-cen-<lb/>
tury <name type="place">England</name>, where there was little distinction between science and art, the two were combined in many ingenious experiments.</p>
<p>The pleasures represented by <name type="pname">Wilton</name> ceased and garden making stopped during the Commonwealth (<date when="1649">1649</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660">1660</date>). Throughout these Puritan times, agri-<lb/>
cultural prosperity was encouraged, but ornamental horticulture was not. Several old gardens were inten-<lb/>
tionally destroyed, and in <name type="place">London</name> some of the royal parks were actually put up for sale. Following the Restoration in <date when="1660">1660</date>, however, royalty and aristocracy vigorously resumed their garden-building activities. The French garden designer <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name> (d. c. <date when="1665">1665</date>), who had introduced the <hi rend="italic">parterre de broderie</hi> to <name type="place">England</name> during the reign of <name type="pname">Charles I</name>, returned and took up the position of Royal Gardener at <name type="pname">St. James</name> and other royal palaces.</p>

<p>At Hampton Court, <name type="pname">Charles II</name>, following his exile in <name type="place">France</name>, began building a garden in which a long canal served as the central axis of an extensive <hi rend="italic">patte d'oie</hi> inspired perhaps by the goose-foot radial avenues earlier introduced by <name type="pname">Mollet</name> (figs. 6.10a, 6.10b).

</figure>
<p>The royal gardens where <name type="pname">Mollet</name> worked are now urban parks, greatly altered through time, and most of the ones of the seventeenth-century nobility have vanished or, like <name type="pname">Wilton</name>, have been revised over the centuries in accordance with new styles and cul-<lb/>
tural values. But the forms of many of these survive in the engravings of <name type="pname">Johannes Kip</name> (<date when="1653">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1722">1722</date>) and <name type="pname">Leonard Knyff</name> (<date when="1579">1579</date>&#x2013;<date when="1649">1649</date>), whose topographical bird's-eye views were published in the early eighteenth century in both English and French: <hi rend="italic">Britannia Illus-<lb/>
trata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Nouveau Th&#x00E9;&#x00E2;tre de la Grande Bretagne</hi>. Con-<lb/>
temporary with <name type="place">Versailles</name> and sometimes vast in scale, the gardens depicted by <name type="pname">Kip</name> and <name type="pname">Knyff</name> include those at Badminton in <name type="place">Gloucestershire</name>, built by <name type="pname">Henry</name>, <name type="place">duke of Beaufort</name>, in <date when="1682">1682</date>, and <name type="pname">Chatsworth</name> in <name type="place">Derbyshire</name>, seat of the dukes of Devonshire, laid out in <date when="1685">1685</date>.</p>
<p>Although their many intricately designed sec-<lb/>
tions were planned symmetrically, these gardens lack the cadenced thrust of strong principal axes and hence the controlling organization and compositional unity found in contemporary French examples (fig. 6.11). Indeed, the transverse axes in these gardens often gain as much as or more importance than the central one. They are Dutch-influenced, and relatively anti-author-<lb/>
itarian in spirit. Many were built following the Glori-<lb/>
ous Revolution of <date when="1688">1688</date> and during the constitutional monarchy of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>. They perhaps also illustrate a characteristically British sense that reti-<lb/>
cence and understatement are nobler attributes of the great and wealthy than ostentatious display.</p>
<p>Dutch influence in British garden design, with its inference of decorous bourgeois prosperity, was carried to some parts of colonial <name type="place">America</name>, notably <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, <name type="place">Virginia</name>. In <name type="place">England</name>, it was evident in the increased use of topiary and canals as garden fea-<lb/>
tures. These canals were not employed in the French manner as extensions of the principal axis; instead, as in the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, designers placed independent bod-<lb/>
ies of water at one side of the garden, often with one or more attendant pavilions, as at Westbury Court, begun at the end of the seventeenth century by <name type="pname">May-<lb/>
nard Colchester</name> on his ancestral estate in <name type="place">Glouces-<lb/>
tershire</name> (fig. 6.12).</p>
<p>Wishing to avoid the bad air of <name type="place">London</name> and the importunate courtiers massed at the old ramshackle palace of Whitehall, <name type="pname">King William</name>, who was asth-<lb/>
matic, and <name type="pname">Queen Mary</name>, who was loath to re-enter
<pb n="203"/>
<pb n="203" type="orig"/>
the atmosphere of court intrigue she had witnessed as the daughter of <name type="pname">James II</name>, chose Hampton Court as their principal residence. They incorporated <name type="pname">Charles II</name>'s initial garden design into a new plan, summoning <name type="pname">Daniel Marot</name> to create the Great Parterre as a plant showcase similar to the one he had made at <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>'s palace of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>. <name type="pname">Queen Mary</name>'s Glass Case Garden for tender exotic plants and elaborate topiary&#x2014;pyramidal yews, clipped box, and globular mounds of bay and holly&#x2014;recalled similar features of <name type="pname">Het Loo</name>. The monarchs also summoned <name type="pname">Christo-<lb/>
pher Wren</name> to build a large new palace adjacent to <name type="pname">Thomas Cardinal Wolsey</name>'s Tudor one. Two impres-<lb/>
sive sides of the proposed square palace block were completed: the facade to the east facing the main gar-<lb/>
den, known as the Great Fountain garden for its large central fountain, and the one on the south looking out upon the Privy Garden.</p>
<p>In <date when="1699">1699</date>, <name type="pname">Henry Wise</name> (<date when="1653">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) lowered and lengthened the Privy Garden in order to provide a view of the river Thames and the Barge Walk. Wise was a partner with <name type="pname">George London</name> (d. <date when="1714">1714</date>) in their recently formed Brompton Park Nurseries in Kens-<lb/>
ington, suppliers of much of the plant material in, as well as designers of, many of the gardens surround-<lb/>
ing the great country seats depicted in the engravings of Kip and Knyff.</p>
<p>Today the enormous overgrown yews in the Great Fountain Garden at Hampton Court, their pyramidal outlines blurred after they were no longer clipped, serve as reminders of the disfavor into which the Anglo-Dutch garden fell in the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury. By contrast, within the principalities of <name type="place">Germany</name>, where aristocratic authoritarianism still prevailed, the classical splendor of <name type="place">Versailles</name> became an almost uni-<lb/>
versal model for courtly gardens and urban planning, although, at least initially, some Italian currents ran northward as well.</p>

<p>Northern humanism, as developed by <name type="pname">Erasmus</name>, was more religious in nature than that of <name type="place">Italy</name>, a cultural fact that influenced landscape design. Although the first Renaissance gardens to be observed and imitated in such prosperous cities as <name type="place">Augsburg</name>, <name type="place">Nuremberg</name>, and <name type="place">Frankfurt</name> were those of <name type="place">Italy</name>, German gardens did not readily incorporate the pagan images and erotically charged atmosphere of Italian models until the liber-<lb/>
tine atmosphere of the eighteenth century permitted such license. The vigorous new garden art that flour-<lb/>
ished in <name type="place">Germany</name> combined French and Dutch influ-<lb/>
ences with Italian ones. Not surprisingly in a country of so many regional power centers, these influences were never amalgamated into a distinctive national style. The many Renaissance gardens that were laid out beside town houses, the residences of archbishops, and the castles of princes were enclosed, compart-<lb/>
mentalized rectangular spaces, axially disconnected from the edifices to which they were attached, with intricately designed <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, tunnel-like arbors, balustraded terraces, tubs of plants, sculptural foun-<lb/>

<p>The most famous German garden in its day was the <name type="place">Hortus Palatinus</name> in <name type="place">Heidelberg</name>, begun in <date when="1615">1615</date> by <name type="pname">Salomon de Caus</name> for <name type="pname">Elizabeth Stuart</name>, daughter of <name type="pname">King James I</name> of <name type="place">England</name>, and her hus-<lb/>
band, <name type="pname">Elector Friedrich V</name> of the Palatinate (fig. 6.14). The garden sits high above the Neckar Valley and consists of a series of L-shaped descending terraces, which were originally subdivided into squares out-<lb/>
lined by pergolas and hedges and ornamented with gazebos, fountains, and statuary. De Caus, being a hydrological engineer and specialist in automata, built numerous grottoes and other water features, which when mechanically activated sounded musi-<lb/>

<p>After the Thirty Years' War ended, garden patrons looked almost entirely to <name type="place">France</name> for inspira-<lb/>

<p>In the politically unstable atmosphere of sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century <name type="place">Germany</name>, authority was fragile and transient, and the princely landscape was often con-<lb/>
structed as a symbolic expression of absolutist power, an assertion of control over potentially fractious municipalities. Karlsruhe, the creation in <date when="1715">1715</date> of <name type="pname">Mar-<lb/>
grave Karl Wilhelm</name> of Baden-Durlach, makes this statement with its spiderweb of avenues radiating out-<lb/>
ward from the palace (fig. 6.16). Their indeterminate length made the entire surrounding countryside appear subservient to the margrave.</p>
<p><name type="place">Vienna</name> itself, the imperial capital, continually feared invasion by the Turks, and it was not until after the decisive victory of <date when="1683">1683</date> that garden build-<lb/>
ing on a significant scale occurred there. In <date when="1693">1693</date>, <name type="pname">Prince Eugene</name> of Savoy, a much-admired hero in the recent war, acquired land outside the southern wall of the city and set about building his Belvedere palace and gardens in the French style, a project not completed until <date when="1732">1732</date> (fig. 6.17). Designed by <name type="pname">Fran&#x00E7;ois Girard</name> in collaboration with the architect <name type="pname">Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt</name> (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>), the gar-<lb/>
dens, with their broad terraced <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, fountain basins, cascades, clipped hedges, and boxlike pavil-<lb/>
ions facing the Orangery, contain faint but percepti-<lb/>
ble echoes of <name type="pname">Vaux-le-Vicomte</name> and <name type="pname">Marly</name>, evidence of Austrian acceptance of French influence with regard to landscape design. However, in <name type="pname">Hilde-<lb/>
brandt</name>'s architecture, which is strongly indebted to the Italian Baroque style of Francesco Borromini, an underlying Austrian anti-French sentiment is perhaps more evident. Other nobles also built luxurious palaces and gardens nearby as <name type="place">Vienna</name> flourished in its status as a world capital.</p>
<p>In <date when="1693">1693</date>, <name type="pname">Emperor Leopold</name> ordered the court architect <name type="pname">Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach</name> (<date when="1656">1656</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723">1723</date>)<ref target="#CH6-n7"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">7</hi></hi></ref> to convert the hunting lodge and park at Sch&#x00F6;nbrunn 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the cen-<lb/>
ter of the city into a palace and grounds that would symbolize in its grandeur and magnificence not only Hapsburg imperial power, but also the triumph of the Christian West over Ottoman rule. The original scheme, determinedly Italian rather than French, placed the palace like a beacon on a hill. This plan was too costly and impractical, however, even for an impe-<lb/>
rial purse, and a revised design located it on the plain below (fig. 6.18).</p>
<p>In <date when="1770">1770</date>, <name type="pname">Empress Maria Theresa</name> commissioned the design services of <name type="pname">Ferdinand Hetzendorf</name> in preparing a final plan for the park. In keeping with
<pb n="205"/>
<pb n="205" type="orig"/>
the taste of the age, the architect added an obelisk and an artificial ruin at the terminus of a new diagonal avenue. At the base of the hill he constructed the Nep-<lb/>
tune pool, and, at the end of the long axis on top, he placed a handsome <hi rend="italic">gloriette</hi>, a neoclassical eye-catcher, that brought the august composition to a fitting cli-<lb/>
max (fig. 6.19).</p>
<p>Near Munich, beginning in <date when="1701">1701</date>, <name type="pname">Max Emanuel</name>, elector of Bavaria, began remodeling the Nymphen-<lb/>
burg, the palace and garden built by his father, <name type="pname">Elec-<lb/>
tor Ferdinand Maria</name>, as a present for his mother, <name type="pname">Henriette Adelaide</name> of Savoy, upon his birth. To accomplish this project he sent the architect <name type="pname">Joseph Effner</name> (<date when="1687">1687</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745">1745</date>) to <name type="place">Paris</name> to study the principles of French landscape design. But it was not only the les-<lb/>
sons of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> that Effner carried home from abroad; he also imbibed the more relaxed spirit of the Rococo, the lighthearted, intimately scaled orna-<lb/>
mental style that originated in <name type="place">France</name> in the early eighteenth century. In essence, the Rococo style con-<lb/>
stitutes a last phase of the Baroque, and it is not as robust in its forms or as sober in its iconography as the Baroque. Rococo designers especially prized ele-<lb/>
gant curvaceousness and delicacy of detail. They put a premium on naturalistic floral and rustic forms as well on the creation in gardens of highly picturesque rustic scenery. They extended the long popularity of the grotto, often incorporating into their plans <hi rend="italic">rocaille</hi>, the amorphous, frequently shell-encrusted, artificial rockwork suggestive of coral reefs and caves.</p>
<p>In Rococo design, Baroque forms have been playfully recast to reflect the mores of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi>, which was bored with the grandeur of author-<lb/>
itarian monarchy, even though most aristocrats still adhered to this collapsing political system. Because of increased Western contact with <name type="place">China</name> and a growing enthusiasm for the decorative arts of that country among European aristocrats, the Rococo style also embodies elements of <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>, the decorative rein-<lb/>
terpretation of Chinese forms that first appeared in the seventeenth century and assumed its full propor-<lb/>
tions in the eighteenth century, when pagodas, "Chi-<lb/>
nese" bridges, and tea pavilions became popular features in Western gardens. Rococo designers put a premium on exoticism in general, incorporating into their landscape plans such ornamental structures as "Egyptian pyramids" and "Turkish tents," festively painted wooden pavilions built in imitation of the silk caravan tents of Islamic royalty.</p>

ment, and the Magdalenenklause (<date when="1725">1725</date>), which he designed as a hermitage. The elements of escapist fantasy and hedonistic gaiety that are the essence of Rococo art and that continue to delight visitors to Nymphenburg can be seen in many other Bavarian gardens including the Hofgarten at Veitsh&#x00F6;chheim near Munich (fig. 6.21).

<p>French landscape style, particularly after its develop-<lb/>
ment into an eighteenth-century Rococo design idiom, was adopted by princes in <name type="place">Hungary</name>, <name type="place">Poland</name>, and <name type="place">Bohemia</name>. Here where the climate is drier than in <name type="place">France</name>, designers omitted the long canals and ornamental lakes that helped drain French gardens and that were used to brilliant effect by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his followers.</p>
<p>When the Hapsburgs expelled the Turks from <name type="place">Hungary</name> in <date when="1686">1686</date>, several Renaissance palaces, which had been neglected since the Ottoman occupation of <date when="1541">1541</date>, began to be restored. The Austrian architect <name type="pname">Johann Lukas van Hildebrandt</name>, built a summer palace for <name type="pname">Prince Eugene</name> of Savoy on one of the islands in the Danube. It was surrounded by a garden that com-<lb/>
bined the French and Italian influences. Although this garden has now vanished, the one built somewhat later during the <date when="1760">1760</date>s at Esterh&#x00E1;za, the estate in Fer-<lb/>
t&#x00F6;d of Prince Mikl&#x00F3;s Esterh&#x00E1;zy, has been preserved and restored. Esterh&#x00E1;za exemplifies the courtly style that prevailed throughout eastern <name type="place">Europe</name> at this time when the Rococo taste was at its height (fig. 6.24). The layout of the <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden, with its flower-<lb/>
edged beds, sandstone urns, statuary, and fountains, was based upon an engraving in <hi rend="italic">Le Jardin de plaisir</hi> (<date when="1651">1651</date>) by <name type="pname">Andr&#x00E9; Mollet</name>. Garden temples, a pair of cas-<lb/>
cades, and a triumphal arch ornamented the <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> surrounding this garden. A Chinese pavilion was built
<pb n="207"/>
<pb n="207" type="orig"/>
in honor of Empress Maria Theresa's visit in <date when="1773">1773</date>. In addition, Esterh&#x00E1;za boasted an opera house, a music building, and a puppet theater. Upon the historic occa-<lb/>
sion of the empress's visit, the court composer, <name type="pname">Franz Joseph Haydn</name>, created two operas to entertain the royal guest. Beyond the ornamental gardens lay a deer park with crisscrossing <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> and also a boar park with avenues radiating from a <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi>.</p>
<p>Although firmly reasserting European stylistic dominance, eighteenth-century Hungarian gardens maintained some of the horticultural elements bequeathed to them by the earlier period of the coun-<lb/>
try's Turkish occupation. These included citrus plants, pomegranates, tulips, and other exotic species. The gardens of the nobility also became showcases for additional non-native species derived from botanical exploration, such as chestnut, catalpa, locust, and hornbeam trees. Like the Rococo follies nearby, exotic plants were prestigious symbols of the garden own-<lb/>
ers' cosmopolitan perspective and scientific interest.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a reaction through-<lb/>
out <name type="place">Europe</name> to the kind of landscapes that perpetu-<lb/>
ated an increasingly discredited authoritarian taste. As we shall see, beginning in the first third of the eigh-<lb/>
teenth century, the English began to produce gardens that were less regular and more naturalistic than those descended from <name type="place">Versailles</name> and derived from the Dutch influence under <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name>. As <name type="place">England</name>'s power as a nation rose, English garden design influ-<lb/>
enced Continental taste to an increasing degree. Near the end of the eighteenth century, many European princes and other aristocrats adopted the style known as <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi>&#x2014;and also as <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi>&#x2014;for their garden-building projects. Further, many of their descendants tore out the garden designs they had inherited when the <hi rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> reached the height of fashion in the nineteenth century. The popularity of the new English landscape style in the latter part of the eighteenth century helps explain why the Rococo effects of this period, such as <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>, were employed equally in both geometrically formal gar-<lb/>
dens and informal ones and also why the naturaliza-<lb/>
tion of exotic plants went on at the same time in the two kinds of landscape. By turning Baroque forms into whimsy, Rococo ornament became suitable within settings that relied on a naturalistic aesthetic as well as within those that still retained classical design principles of axiality and symmetry. Similarly, exotic plants complemented the penchant for the bizarre found in French Rococo gardens, but these could be also naturalized within a less contrived "Eng-<lb/>
lish" landscape.</p>

Fountains, sculpture, and a row of <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> were placed on a lower terrace (fig. 6.25).

These designers modified the
<pb n="209"/>

French style so that it became a national variant.</p>
<p>The gardens of the royal palace of <name type="place">Drottning-<lb/>
holm</name>, which were commissioned by the dowager queen <name type="pname">Hedvig Eleonora</name> in <date when="1681">1681</date>, constitute the mas-<lb/>
terwork of <name type="pname">Tessin</name> the Younger (figs. 6.27, 6.28). In the sections of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>'s <hi rend="italic">La Th&#x00E9;orie et la prac-<lb/>
tique du jardinage</hi> that he later copied as an instructive text for his son, <name type="pname">Carl Gustaf</name>, <name type="pname">Tessin</name> appended commentaries relating to the adaptation of French landscape principles to Nordic conditions. At <name type="place">Drot-<lb/>
tningholm</name>, he had the hard bedrock blasted away to create a flat plane for the <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi> that he adapted from his drawings of French examples. He organized these along a single longitudinal axis. Where he could not remove a particularly massive outcrop, he disguised it by building across its face an architectural cascade.

<p>The landscape style carried out by <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> was a highly cosmopolitan one. Although derived principally from <name type="place">France</name>, it was also shaped by contributions from Italian and Dutch sources. The teams of foreign and native architects and the army of serf laborers who built it were part of an even greater enterprise begun by <name type="pname">Peter</name> in <date when="1712">1712</date>: the construction of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, a capital, industrial city, and naval and mercantile port on the muddy banks of the Neva River. The story of its creation is in this chapter's dis-<lb/>
cussion of the application of the principles of Baroque landscape design to urban planning.</p>
<p>By the time of <name type="pname">Catherine the Great</name> (ruled <date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">1796</date>), English influence had superseded the French in <name type="place">Russia</name>. The empress, who professed to Voltaire in <date when="1772">1772</date>, "I now love to distraction gardens in the English style," hired the English-trained landscape gardener <name type="pname">John Busch</name> (fl. <date when="1730">1730</date>s&#x2013;<date when="1790">1790</date>s) to create a pic-<lb/>
turesque park with meandering water bodies at the summer palace of <name type="pname">Tsarskoye Selo</name> outside <name type="place">St. Peters-<lb/>
burg</name>. The plan for this landscape, which lies adjacent to the earlier Baroque <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bosquets</hi>, bears a superficial resemblance to that of the park that <name type="pname">Gus-<lb/>
tav III</name> and <name type="pname">Piper</name> built next to the French-inspired gar-<lb/>
dens at <name type="place">Drottningholm</name>. <name type="pname">Tsarskoye Selo</name>, like the Swedish royal gardens, boasts several <hi rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi>-style pavilions. But to appreciate the breadth of stylistic possibilities found in eighteenth-century landscape design, one must mentally traverse the European con-<lb/>
tinent to its westernmost extremity where French and English influence remained slight, allowing a vigor-<lb/>
ous Iberian version of Baroque and Rococo garden art to flourish.</p>

<p>The Portuguese conquerors who garnered imperial wealth from the <name type="place">East Indies</name> and <name type="place">Brazil</name> built churches, palaces, and monasteries. They also ornamented their small, hilly country with many beautiful gardens that creatively amalgamated several foreign influences. Because of the country's favorable climate, they were able to naturalize many exotic plant species collected by <name type="pname">Jesuit</name> missionaries from abroad. The marquess of Pombal established a botanical garden at Coimbra, the seat of an important Portuguese university, in <date when="1772">1772</date>, and a botanical garden was set up at the same time in Lisbon.</p>
<p>The Portuguese were the heirs of Islamic <name type="place">Spain</name>. Glazed tiles&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">azulejos</hi>&#x2014;painted with arabesque and geometric designs in tones of yellow, blue, and green, had long been manufactured there, and by the fif-<lb/>
teenth century, these were being imported to <name type="place">Portu-<lb/>
gal</name> where they were applied to many kinds of walls and floors, including those found in several gardens.</p>
<p>The Portuguese established their own tile fac-<lb/>
tories as the craft waned in <name type="place">Spain</name>. They expanded their palette of colors and substituted pictorial motifs for the abstract ones required by Islam. At the same time, they devised composite images by fitting together several square tiles. As Baroque and Rococo motifs gained artistic currency, the Portuguese became the undisputed masters of tile design, creat-<lb/>
ing numerous exuberant patterns. This tilework con-<lb/>
stitutes an important element in their virtuosic blending of Islamic, Spanish, Italian, and French influences into an original national landscape style (figs. 6.31, 6.32).</p>
<p>Water tanks, an Islamic legacy, are particularly important features in Portuguese gardens. In sum-<lb/>
<pb n="211"/>

mer droughts, they ensured both the residential water supply and the irrigation of the garden's plants. They were usually placed in a fairly elevated position to allow the water to be distributed by force of gravity. Here the reflectivity of both water and tile combine with the designer's imagination to make these utili-<lb/>
tarian structures into delightfully decorative garden features, as at the Quinta da Balcalhoa and the Pal&#x00E1;-<lb/>
cio dos Marqueses de Fronteira (figs. 6.33, 6.34).</p>
<p>Replete with ornament and sculpture, seven-<lb/>
teenth- and eighteenth-century Portuguese gardens are nevertheless conservative in their overall design. Although some box parterres were laid out in <hi rend="italic">broderie</hi> designs, the design of others, such as that at the Pal&#x00E1;-<lb/>
cio Fronteira, where there is an intricate maze, harks back stylistically to the Renaissance. Decorative shell-<lb/>
work similar to that found in Italian Mannerist grot-<lb/>
toes is abundant here. Even more important, these Portuguese gardens are spatially contained; they are old-fashioned for their day in having walls and also in their absence of strong axial organization. Garden designers adapted their schemes to existing topogra-<lb/>
phy and did not practice extensive regrading, as was the case in contemporary gardens elsewhere in <name type="place">Europe</name>. Their loggia terraces were built for viewing <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> designs from above, but otherwise they have no connection with the plan of the garden. Although backward-looking in these ways, the gardens that were built in <name type="place">Portugal</name> at this time are highly original. In their exuberant exploitation of the design oppor-<lb/>
tunities inherent in a regional commodity&#x2014;glazed tiles&#x2014;the Portuguese confidently forged their own distinctive landscape idiom.</p>

<p>By the eighteenth century, the Picturesque style had begun to establish a powerful counterinfluence to that of <name type="place">Versailles</name>. Aristocrats felt increasing financial con-<lb/>

<p>Although many notable gardens were produced by the fusion in the eighteenth century of the pre-<lb/>
dominant French influence with that of other tradi-<lb/>
tions, of even greater consequence was the more far-reaching and long-lasting effect of landscape design from this era on the planning of cities. Increasingly, as monarchical authority sought to glorify itself on a public scale, not just the royal demesne but the entire capital city became the focus of monumental urban-<lb/>
ism. The idea that cities could be planned according to Baroque and French seventeenth-century design principles was suited, moreover, to the rising tide of nationalism and the desire to find an urban form that was expressive of the power of the state.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div type="section">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">II. The Heroic City: Expressions of Classical and Baroque Urbanism</hi></head>
<p>By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the appearance of cityscapes owed much to the lessons landscape design professionals had learned in the sev-<lb/>
enteenth century. Axial extension, <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> defined by ranks of trees, intersections marked with fountains or other central features, sculpture and monuments with programmatic content&#x2014;these are, as we have seen, the basic ingredients of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s garden style. <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> had conceived the plan for the town of <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name> as integral with that of the gardens of the palace, and <name type="pname">Margrave Karl Wilhelm</name> had treated town and park in a similar fashion at Karlsruhe (see fig. 6.16). But royal patronage was not strictly necessary for the further development of this style of urbanism. Throughout the seventeenth century, with the rise of the middle class, cities gained increasing autonomy and became more than court appendages, episcopal seats, or mere trading centers. National governments and municipal corporations employed architects, engineers, and artists to revise and extend their lay-<lb/>
outs and to embellish them in a manner that pro-<lb/>
moted state and civic pride.</p>
<p>The resulting form of urbanism, which has remained a valid paradigm for planners down to modern times, was thus concomitant with the growth of nation-states and the status of the city as an expression of the wealth and virtue of its citizenry. The premise of infinitely extensible axes that is cen-<lb/>
tral to this manner of design foreshadowed the dis-<lb/>
appearance of city walls as nations came into
<pb n="213"/>
<pb n="213" type="orig"/>
existence and city-states ceased to function as inde-<lb/>
pendent and autonomous political units. In addition, with the seventeenth-century technical invention of spring suspension and the introduction of plate-glass windows, carriage travel became a sociable pastime as well as a comparatively efficient means of loco-<lb/>
motion, and this fact had obvious consequences for the scale of streets and the design of cities.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">The Principal Elements of the Baroque Cityscape</hi></head>
<p>The first step in the transformation from high-walled citadel to the modern city occurred when military engineers developed a new system of defense employing projecting bastions instead of battlements. With their "ears" and pointed triangular "demi-lunes," these strategic constructions were built to withstand cannon siege while allowing the defending artillery maximum protection as they fired back along a series of intersecting diagonal sight lines. In plan, they form starburst patterns. Like the gardens of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>, they thrust outward, metaphorically invading space.<ref target="#CH6-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">9</hi></hi></ref> As interior cities became increasingly secure behind chains of fort cities constructed along their frontiers, their fortifications began to be eliminated, and even the new bulwarks in time gave way to boulevards, tree-planted ring roads that attracted recreational activity, notably carriage driving and promenading, which in turn gave rise to nineteenth-century shop-<lb/>
ping and caf&#x00E9; life.</p>
<p>Military engineers such as <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s contem-<lb/>
porary <name type="pname">S&#x00E9;bastien Le Prestre de Vauban</name> (<date when="1633">1633</date>&#x2013;<date when="1707">1707</date>) were frequently called upon to lay out cities.<ref target="#CH6-n10"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">10</hi></hi></ref> Their plans demanded the abandonment of the "organic" approach to urbanism characteristic of many older cities and the subordination of everyday life to a con-<lb/>
ceptual order based on symbolical intent as well as practical considerations. Even where the perennially useful grid was employed, the underlying symbolism of the Baroque cityscape, which pressed Renaissance humanism into the service of proclaiming princely power, demanded its ruthless interruption by radials emanating like the rays of the sun from the court or seat of government. It is because of its indifference to the requirements of the daily lives of ordinary indi-<lb/>
viduals that urban historians&#x2014;<name type="pname">Lewis Mumford</name>, for one&#x2014;have judged this kind of authoritarian planning harshly. But its compensatory offering was theatri-<lb/>
cality and a new vision of the dignity of public space and public life in which a reciprocity of sight lines between civic institutions symbolically expressed the political and cultural aspirations of the society.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi> with its long vistas along the straight diagonals of the hunting park provided a new model for radial thoroughfares emanating from a cir-<lb/>
cle in a star pattern, facilitating both the movement of ordinary traffic and military troops in an emer-<lb/>
gency, while considerably increasing the dynamism and drama of city space. The tree-lined <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> found in French gardens provided a model for street tree planting. They are the progenitors not only of broad avenues for pleasant strolling, but also of tree-lined processional and parade routes like the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es in <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Avenue in <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington, D.C.</name> Embellished by obelisks, portals, arches, fountains, monuments, and sculptures that serve as place fixers for squares and circles that punctuate their length and provide a cadence to the movement along them, these ceremonial axes dramatize the city and articulate messages of civic pride and national power.</p>
<p>Urban squares were intentionally designed as stages for public life and heroic commemoration. Even without the foci of fountains and monuments, these architecturally conceived spaces conveyed a powerful sense of place and became elements of the imagery that gave each city its individual character in the minds of its citizens and visitors. In addition, the Baroque cityscape was one in which heights were dramatized; the lofty church or palace, the proud hill-<lb/>
top monument, the urban cascade, and the grand stairway provided urban distinction and sense of place.</p>
<p>The Baroque cityscape married the apprecia-<lb/>
tion of real and symbolic order characteristic of French classicism to the instinct for dramatic siting and theatrical effects found in Italian landscape design. The combined genius of <name type="pname">Michelangelo</name>, <name type="pname">Bernini</name>, and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> helped shape a new urban form that inspired plans for the layout of cities on a grand scale suitable to new modes of transportation. More orderly than any plans since the days of the Roman Empire, these also envisioned new standards of public sanitation and safety as well as new standards of public recre-<lb/>
ation and entertainment.</p>

<p>In Bernini, <name type="place">Rome</name> had a sculptor capable of aggrandizing the urban plan of <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> which we examined in Chapter Four. He brought to the secular imagery of the city's public spaces the same powers of dramatic composition one finds in his commissions for the Counter-Reformation Church. In addition to remodeling the <name type="pname">Acqua Vergine Antica</name>,<ref target="#CH6-n11"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">11</hi></hi></ref> he created two fountains at the Piazza Barberini&#x2014;the Fountain of the Triton and the Fountain of the Bees from the Barberini pope's coat of arms (fig. 6.36). His master-<lb/>
piece stands at the center of the Piazza Navona: the Fountain of the Four Rivers, with its four symbolic river gods. These figures are not self-contained and lan-<lb/>
guidly at rest like the river gods of antiquity, but actively twist and gesture like actors in a dramatic tableau.</p>
<p>From today's vantage point, it is sometimes dif-<lb/>
ficult to remember that even with the construction of new streets and significant works of architecture, seventeenth-century cities were far more rural in char-<lb/>
acter than ours. Though some streets were paved, many were not, and we see with surprise in seven-<lb/>
teenth- and eighteenth-century prints of <name type="place">Rome</name> the still-rough, undressed character of the surrounding ground plane and the quasi-rustic character of the public life within the spaces that envelop these archi-<lb/>
tectural and sculptural masterpieces. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, <name type="place">Rome</name> was the most sophisticated and urbane city in the West-<lb/>
ern world. With its numerous ruins as testaments of its historical greatness, it was a place in which one felt the poetics of the collapsed centuries. Added to this was the festive air of papal pomp and worldly pleas-<lb/>
ure made manifest in stone. These provided ample basis for <name type="place">Rome</name>'s growing international reputation as a place of unrivaled wonders.</p>
<p>With its new fountains and treasure trove of ancient artifacts ready-made for urban scenography, <name type="place">Rome</name> provided a vocabulary of forms for cityscapes elsewhere. It also initiated the characteristically Baroque concept of dynamic movement through space, an idea that had its roots in the Mannerists' con-<lb/>
cern with perspective and that now made a sensual experience of the eye's journey through space. Baroque spatial organization was not merely hori-<lb/>
zontal; the architectural embellishment of heights with buildings, monuments, and grand stairs of ascent gave a vertical dimension to movement. The animated movement of water rising and falling into Roman fountains and, in addition, the gestural sculp-<lb/>
ture that ornamented them added further spatial drama to the urban scene.</p>
<p>Essentially plastic in their formal orientation and theatrical in their approach, Roman designers devel-<lb/>
oped an urbanism that thrived on incident, creating a street network of interrelated points of interest rather than, as in <name type="place">France</name>, an exploration of the possi-<lb/>
bilities of space for its own sake. Roman urbanism contained a celebratory message, one that sought to dazzle the senses and awe the mind with the reaf-<lb/>
firmed glory of the Catholic Church and the resur-<lb/>
rected splendor of the imperial past. French urbanists, on the other hand, with less emotional exuberance, greater reliance on intellect and reason, and a gift for centralized administration, dramatized the power of the modern state. The manifestation of this power in an overall plan for <name type="place">Paris</name> in which <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s seem-<lb/>
ingly infinite axes were applied on a civic scale would, given <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>'s preoccupation with <name type="place">Versailles</name>, nec-<lb/>
essarily await a later age, that of <name type="pname">Napoleon III</name> in the nineteenth century (see Chapter Ten). As we saw in Chapter Four, the groundwork for that urbanistic feat had already been laid even before the time of <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> in the series of projects undertaken in <name type="place">Paris</name> during the rule of <name type="pname">Henry IV</name> at the dawn of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In <name type="place">Paris</name>, as in <name type="place">Italy</name>, the invention of the spring-sus-<lb/>

la-Reine laid out for carriage promenaders on the out-<lb/>
skirts of the city along the banks of the Seine to the west of the Tuileries (fig. 6.37). Quadruple rows of elms created three avenues almost a mile in length, bringing not only the amenity of the tree-lined street to <name type="place">Paris</name>, but also the socialization of urban space. Peo-<lb/>
ple had discovered, along with the visual and physical enjoyment of movement itself, the theatrical possi-<lb/>
<pb n="215"/>
<pb n="215" type="orig"/>
bilities of street life with its daily spectacle of carriages and promenaders. Bewigged and dressed in silks and lace, the socially ambitious saw themselves as pro-<lb/>
tagonists in the diurnal drama of meeting and greet-<lb/>
ing one another in public. The Cours-la-Reine was soon thronged with carriages, one more opulently appointed than the next, and its popularity was so great that on the opposite side of town the <name type="pname">Cours St.-<lb/>
Antoine</name> was inaugurated on the rue <name type="pname">St.-Antoine</name>, the main ceremonial entry to <name type="place">Paris</name> from the east along the road from Vincennes. Here the trees were planted to form twin all&#x00E9;es for promenading with a broad car-<lb/>
riage drive in between. To extend it eastward, the Cours de Vincennes was built in the <date when="1660">1660</date>s.</p>
<p>The most important <hi rend="italic">cours</hi> of all was that initi-<lb/>
ated by <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name> around <date when="1670">1670</date> when the axis of the Tuileries, called the Grand Cours, was extended approximately a mile into the open countryside to the &#x00C9;toile, as the <hi rend="italic">rond-point</hi> with its starburst of radiating avenues is called. Between this axis and the Cours-la-<lb/>
Reine beside the Seine, royal gardeners planted a stretch of ground as a quincunx&#x2014;a regular arrange-<lb/>
ment of trees set in a pattern composed of multiple units of five, in which four trees comprise the angles of a square or rectangle, while the fifth serves to mark its center. The poetic name for this grove was Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, meaning the Elysian Fields. Another short axis connected the Cours-la-Reine with the wide, tree-<lb/>
bordered carriage drive and promenade of the Grand Cours. Today the Grand Cours bears the name of the old grove beside it and is known as the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es. Since <name type="pname">Napoleon</name> located his Arc de Triomphe in the center of <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>'s &#x00C9;toile, <name type="place">Paris</name> has effectively faced west instead of east toward Vincennes, and while the recreational nature of the Grand Cours still lingers in the recently restored promenades and caf&#x00E9;s lining the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, the route has also served for the last two hundred years as the city's principal ceremonial thoroughfare.</p>

struction of a new system of <hi rend="italic">boulevarts</hi> (bastions), and from the beginning these were designed to form a green girdle of wide tree-lined carriage drives and promenades, the forerunner of the circumferential modern boulevards built at grade level when the <hi rend="italic">boulevart</hi> walls were at last removed. Since the con-<lb/>
struction of these new bastions stretched well into the eighteenth century, it became increasingly appar-<lb/>
ent that even their modest pretence at defense was both useless and unnecessary, and the city began to spread freely, incorporating into itself the surround-<lb/>
ing <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi>. Moreover, it probably became apparent to government authorities that, although they served as a convenient customs barrier and a good lookout for patrolling sentinels posted to keep the peace, the walls might even assist rebellion and mob usurpation of power within <name type="place">Paris</name> if a revolutionary force gained control of them. Thus the primary function of the boulevards, or <hi rend="italic">remparts</hi>, as they continued to be called, was one of recreational circulation, and cafes and other places of entertainment eventually sprang up along the more frequented ones such as the popular Boulevard du Nord.</p>

<p>One can only imagine what <name type="place">Paris</name> might have looked like today had <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> chosen to follow <name type="pname">Col-<lb/>
bert</name>'s advice and made it his capital. Since the king visited the city only four times during the last twenty-<lb/>
two years of his life, it is understandable that <name type="place">Paris</name> received but two new squares during his reign: the Place des Victoires (<date when="1682">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687">87</date>) and the Place <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name> (<date when="1699">1699</date>, today the Place Vend&#x00F4;me). Both were built by <name type="pname">Jules Hardouin-Mansart</name>, the court architect, as squares defined by uniform architectural facades, spaces in which to place a statue of the king. Of greater consequence to the welfare of the city's pop-<lb/>
ulation, <name type="pname">Colbert</name> had fifteen new public fountains built and torch lamps installed for nighttime illumination. Nevertheless, not having the king's firm backing for comprehensive urban planning, he left <name type="place">Paris</name> a city bet-<lb/>
ter known abroad for its offal-filled streets than for this modicum of public health and security or its iso-<lb/>
lated architectural gems and new rampart boulevards.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Louis XV</name> (<date when="1710">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1774">1774</date>) left his mark on eigh-<lb/>
teenth-century <name type="place">Paris</name> with the construction of several squares, of which the most notable is the Place <name type="pname">Louis XV</name> renamed the Place de la Concorde (<date when="1763">1763</date>). Located at the junction of the Tuileries axis with that of the Champs &#x00C9;lys&#x00E9;es, it was designed by <name type="pname">Jacques-Ange Gabriel</name> (<date when="1698">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1782">1782</date>) with eight stone pavilions repre-<lb/>
senting the provincial capitals of <name type="place">France</name>. These framed the square; its centerpiece was a bronze sculp-<lb/>
ture of the king. Because of its prominence and asso-<lb/>
<pb n="216"/>
<pb n="216" type="orig"/>
ciation with royalty, it became the site of many guil-<lb/>
lotine executions during the Rev-<lb/>
olution, including that of <name type="pname">Louis XVI</name> (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">1792</date>). To replace the central sculpture which had been destroyed during the Rev-<lb/>
olution, the Obelisk of Luxor, commemorating the deeds of <name type="pname">Ramesses II</name> and originally located in front of the Temple of Thebes in <name type="place">Upper Egypt</name>, was pre-<lb/>
sented by the viceroy of <name type="place">Egypt</name>, <name type="pname">Muhammad &#x00C1;li</name>, to the French king <name type="pname">Louis-Philippe</name> (ruled <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>) in <date when="1831">1831</date>. This valued gift enabled <name type="place">Paris</name> to follow the example set by <name type="pname">Sixtus V</name> in <name type="place">Rome</name> by establishing an Egyptian obelisk as the focus of an important urban square (fig. 6.38; see fig. 4.38).</p>

<p>The fixity of human settlement is such that, unless a powerful authoritarian will can exert control, patterns of land occupancy generally resist radical alteration. Even when opportunities to rebuild anew arise after such calamities as war and fire, in their efforts to re-<lb/>
establish property ownership and a sense of histori-<lb/>
cal continuity and place, people prefer old circulation patterns and building lot configurations to new ones, although the new ones may be considerably more convenient and attractive. In such dire circumstances, people become instinctive preservationists. The urbanistic history of seventeenth-century <name type="place">London</name> proves the point.</p>
<p><name type="place">London</name>'s disastrous fire of <date when="1666">1666</date> destroyed almost 400 acres within its walls and an additional 60 outside, leaving a huge semicircle of smoldering ruins. In addition to eighty-seven parish churches and many other public buildings including those housing the entire financial and mercantile districts, 13,200 houses went up in flames leaving nearly a quarter million people homeless.<ref target="#CH6-n12"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">12</hi></hi></ref> While this was a disaster of greater magnitude than the historic loss of the Vesuvian cities in 79 <hi rend="smallcaps">c.e.</hi> because of <name type="place">London</name>'s larger population, it also provided an opportunity to rebuild the urban core and its surrounding precincts. Following the fire, <name type="pname">Christopher Wren</name>, <name type="pname">John Evelyn</name>, and others presented plans that incorporated the lessons of both <name type="place">Versailles</name> and <name type="place">Rome</name>. But these were soon shelved, and <name type="place">London</name> rebuilt itself not according to a grand plan, but piece-<lb/>
meal over the next fifty years along the lines of its old streets and lanes.</p>
<p>The walls of <name type="place">London</name>, like those of <name type="place">Paris</name>, grad-<lb/>
ually fell into disuse, and, with the city's continued res-<lb/>
idential growth as its population climbed to overtake that of any European city, a number of residential squares were laid out by developers. In Westminster and the West End, as well as in Bloomsbury east of those areas, leaseholds to great mansions and their gardens were sold to building developers, but the landowners' names and titles were commemorated in the new streets and squares that took their place. The notion of the symmetrical planned square with architecturally unified building facades and a ground-<lb/>
floor arcade had been borrowed from <name type="place">Italy</name> by <name type="pname">Inigo Jones</name> (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652">1652</date>) when he built Covent Garden as a speculation for the fourth earl of Bedford in <date when="1639">1639</date> (fig. 6.39). Specifically, the great neo-Palladian architect had modeled his plan for Covent Garden on that of the Piazza d'Arme built by the Medici dukes in the fortress and port town of Livorno at the end of the sixteenth century, a symmetrical square of arcaded buildings (fig. 6.40).<ref target="#CH6-n13"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">13</hi></hi></ref> Initially an address for the well-born, Covent Garden became a market square in <date when="1671">1671</date> and,
<pb n="217"/>
<pb n="217" type="orig"/>
with the licensing of the nearby <name type="pname">Drury Lane Theater</name>, the nucleus of the performing arts district that flour-<lb/>
ished there in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>At the same time that Covent Garden Piazza (as it was first called) was being built, the layout of another group of speculative houses around <name type="pname">Lincoln'</name>s Inn Fields was under way. In the early <date when="1660">1660</date>s at Bloomsbury Square, the fourth earl of Southampton set the pattern of residential development that became common in <name type="place">London</name> after the Great Fire as land-owning aristocrats realized the profits to be made by turning landlord. Bloomsbury Square lots varied in size, and leases specified only that houses be reasonably large and of a suitably dignified character. From this point forward, the squares of <name type="place">London</name> assumed a more heterogeneous, less authoritarian appearance than their Continental counterparts. They were greener, too, for, whereas Parisian squares had been planned as public spaces, in <name type="place">London</name>, where there was no tradition of their public use as promenades or arenas for spectacles, they were often designed as fenced and locked gardens, with keys provided only to those whose houses fronted upon them. This dif-<lb/>
ference between the squares of <name type="place">Paris</name> and <name type="place">London</name> was perpetuated in the nineteenth century when <name type="pname">Baron Haussmann</name>, <name type="pname">Louis-Napol&#x00E9;on</name>'s Prefect of the Seine, built several new ones as landscaped islands within <name type="place">Paris</name>'s improved circulation system, whereas those of <name type="place">London</name> continued to be planted as quasi-private gar-<lb/>
dens for adjacent residents.</p>
<p>In the busy building years following the Great Fire, many of the <name type="place">London</name> squares that today con-<lb/>
tribute greatly to the city's green and pleasant char-<lb/>
acter took shape. With the development of elegant Grosvenor Square between <date when="1725">1725</date> and <date when="1731">1731</date>, <name type="place">London</name>'s largest square with the exception of <name type="pname">Lincoln</name>'s Inn Fields, Mayfair became the district of choice for many titled people (fig. 6.41). On the neighboring estate to the east, <name type="place">Berkeley</name> Square continued the now-familiar pattern of Georgian town houses facing a common green. With the exception of Covent Garden, which early assumed its character as a public space, most of these greens remained discreetly sequestered behind iron palings and off limits to passersby. It was not until <date when="1832">1832</date> with the creation of Trafalgar Square, where ten years later the naval victory of <name type="pname">Lord Nelson</name> was memorialized with a 145-foot- (44-meter-) high col-<lb/>
umn, that <name type="place">London</name> received a nonresidential public square and urban landmark similar in spirit to the piazzas of <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>

<p>Seventeenth-century <name type="place">London</name> offered other places in which the gregarious could congregate. The same cultural forces that were at work in <name type="place">Paris</name> and else-<lb/>
where were at work in <name type="place">London</name>, too, creating a new element of the population attached to the court yet flourishing with growing independence from it. With increased wealth derived from manufacturing and trade and the first wave of riches from overseas colonies, "society" had come into being. The growth of cities during this period was accompanied by a change in their character. They no longer functioned simply as fortified centers of production, exchange, and religious celebration. Cities in the seventeenth century, especially capital cities like <name type="place">London</name> and <name type="place">Paris</name>, became places of pleasure and, to a greater degree than was true of cities since antiquity, places where ideas as well as goods were traded, the wombs of intellectual discovery and ideology. The need of the new leisure class for entertainment as well as for intel-<lb/>
lectual and social stimulation brought into being new urban forms: the coffeehouse and its French variant the caf&#x00E9;, as well as the theater and the promenade.</p>

<p>To conduct business, to display status, to adver-<lb/>
tise marriageability (or availability if one was a cour-<lb/>
tesan)&#x2014;for these and other reasons one needed a public sphere, a defined space where, with predictable regularity, one could be sure of meeting and greeting one's own kind. The promenade, or the parade as it was also called, served this function. In the same way that boulevards came to lose their association with fortifications and began to be built independent of the location of former city walls, malls for prome-<lb/>
nading&#x2014;the descendants of the once-popular game of pall-mall, which originated in <name type="place">Italy</name>&#x2014;became urban features in their own right. <name type="pname">Samuel Pepys</name>'s diary brings the public life of all these sociable public spaces vividly to life, coloring in their outlines with con-<lb/>
temporary observation and anecdotal detail. Pepys and his fellow government servants, together with all elements of society could be seen parading whenever the weather was fine in <name type="pname">St. James</name>'s Park along <name type="pname">Charles II</name>'s pall-mall alley, which was surfaced with well-<lb/>
watered pulverized cockleshells. Nearby the king built <name type="pname">Catherine</name> Street, named for the queen. It soon assumed its popular name, Pall Mall, as it has been known ever since (fig. 6.42).</p>
<p>Although the royal parks belonged to the crown, it was customary by the seventeenth century for royalty to share them with the public. In Green Park, <name type="pname">Charles II</name> enjoyed fraternizing with his subjects as he took his daily stroll along Constitution Hill, as the broad walk at the southern end of the park is still called. In the eighteenth century, Queen Caroline, the wife of <name type="pname">George II</name>, had the Queen's Walk built along its less public eastern border, for by that time the park had become crowded with Londoners enjoying them-<lb/>
selves as they strolled along its crisscrossing web of gravel paths set amid green grass. During its long his-<lb/>
tory as an urban public space, Green Park also served as a place for military parades, public celebrations, duels, and in the nineteenth century, numerous hot-<lb/>
air balloon ascents.</p>
<p>Long popular as the scene of May Day celebra-<lb/>
tions, Hyde Park, which had been sold by Parliament in the time of <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>, was repossessed in <date when="1660">1660</date> by <name type="pname">Charles II</name> and turned into a resort of fashion (fig. 6.43). The park was enclosed by a brick wall and the Ring, first called the Tour, was laid out by the king as a carriage promenade for the <hi rend="italic">beau monde</hi>. <name type="pname">Rotten Row</name>, a corruption of <hi rend="italic">route du roi</hi>, the link between Ken-<lb/>
sington and <name type="pname">St. James</name>'s Palaces, became the first illu-<lb/>
minated thoroughfare in <name type="place">England</name> when <name type="pname">William III</name> ascended the throne and, upon taking up residence in Kensington Palace, had some 300 lamps installed in the branches of the trees along its borders as a deterrent to the highwaymen who threatened night-<lb/>
time security.</p>
<p>Like the gardens of Buckingham Palace today, Kensington Gardens was in the beginning reserved for the private enjoyment of the king and queen. <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> had the gardens laid out in the Dutch fashion by <name type="pname">Henry Wise</name> (<date when="1653">1653</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) and <name type="pname">George London</name> (d. <date when="1714">1714</date>). Considerably altered by <name type="pname">Queen Anne</name>, they were not opened to the public until <name type="pname">George II</name> permitted "respectably dressed people" to frequent them on Saturdays. By granting this per-<lb/>
mission he turned the Broad Walk into a fashionable promenade running from north to south in front of the palace.</p>
<p><name type="place">London</name>, then, was throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a city growing piecemeal, district by district, as the properties of several noble families who had the good fortune to own land were turned into profitable real-estate speculations. It there-<lb/>
fore had no sense of overall order based upon a com-<lb/>
prehensive plan. Its character is limned by historical circumstance rather than by a grand design. As will become apparent from an examination of the history of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, bold urban design visions stand a greater chance of realization where there is no pre-<lb/>
existing urban fabric and where there is sufficient cen-<lb/>
tralized authority to ensure their construction in accordance with a master plan.</p>

<p>If <name type="place">London</name> provides an early example of laissez-faire capitalism as one of the driving forces of city develop-<lb/>
ment, <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> provides its opposite: an autocratic city created by fiat and planned entirely by government decree. The story of its founding is legendary.</p>
<p>We may imagine <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name>, the imperi-<lb/>
ous autocrat portayed in &#x00C9;tienne Maurice Falconet's bronze equestrian sculpture and Pushkin's sinister poem <hi rend="italic">The Bronze Horseman</hi>, bestriding the banks of the Neva, commanding the waves to subside and an army of conscripted serfs to implement his vision of a mighty Baltic port, <name type="place">Russia</name>'s "window to the West." The historic decision was made in <date when="1703">1703</date> after his return from Holland and <name type="place">England</name> where, traveling incognito, he had worked as a ship's carpenter and studied shipbuilding at the Royal Navy's impressive modern dockyard at Deptford. Determined to recon-<lb/>
quer the Baltic provinces that had been lost to <name type="place">Swe-<lb/>
den</name>, he set about building the Fortress of <name type="pname">St. Peter</name> and <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> on an island at the mouth of the river. Here the Neva&#x2014;named for its chief characteristic, mud&#x2014;had formed a swampy delta. Its branches had created a series of islands that, together with the mainland on the left bank, became the site of the future capital. Only the mightiest act of will bolstered by supreme authority and supported by the callous consumption of virtually unlimited human resources could have turned this desolate northern outpost on a remote fringe of <name type="place">Russia</name>, occupied by only a few rude cottages of Finnish fishermen, into one of the world's most beautiful cities.<ref target="#CH6-n14"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">14</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>Peter's victory over the Swedes at Poltava in <date when="1709">1709</date> provided the necessary security for him to move the Russian capital from <name type="place">Moscow</name> to <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>. In spite of uncontrolled periodic disastrous flooding, fires, and wolves roaming the streets, it was soon the home of the imperial family, and a decree of <date when="1716">1716</date> enjoined a hundred noble families to also take up res-<lb/>
idence in these Baltic wilds. Another edict that year conscripted 40,000 workers from the provinces. All stone construction was forbidden in <name type="place">Moscow</name> in order to channel both masons and that scarce building material into <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>. Personally indifferent to luxury, Peter nevertheless imposed building regula-<lb/>
tions that dictated a standard of grandeur for the palaces that his reluctantly relocated nobles were forced to build.</p>
<p>The appearance of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> was to be unequivocally Western. In <date when="1703">1703</date>, Peter appointed the Italian architect <name type="pname">Domenico Trezzini</name> (<date when="1670">1670</date>&#x2013;<date when="1734">1734</date>) as his first Master of Building, Construction, and Fortifica-<lb/>
tion. After <date when="1713">1713</date>, Trezzini was succeeded by the Ger-<lb/>
man Andreas Schl&#x00FC;ter (c. <date when="1659">1659</date>&#x2013;<date when="1714">1714</date>), who brought in his train several younger architects. These young men were able to provide the talent necessary to keep up the frantic pace of building after Schl&#x00FC;ter's death the following year. In <date when="1716">1716</date>, <name type="pname">Alexandre Le Blond</name> signed a contract to serve as architect general of <name type="place">St. Peters-<lb/>
burg</name> for five years. To carry out his designs he brought with him several skilled artisans and workmen.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-265">
<graphic url="CH6_047.jpg"/>
<figDesc>6.44. Plan of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name></figDesc>
</figure>
<p><name type="pname">Le Blond</name> laid out the Nevsky Prospekt, the northern arm of what was to become three radial avenues focused on the Admiralty, which was topped with a 235-foot- (71.6-meter-) tall spire that, like a mag-<lb/>
net, drew the city toward its symbolic and actual <hi rend="italic">rai-<lb/>
son d'&#x00EA;tre</hi>, the great docking facility beside the swift-flowing Neva (fig. 6.44). Stretching for 2.75 miles southeast, the Nevsky Prospekt crossed the Moika River and the Katherine and Fontanka Canals before bending and narrowing somewhat as it continued toward its conclusion at the <name type="pname">Alexander Nevsky Monastery</name> At first it was simply a 115-foot- (35-meter-) wide, straight, stone-paved avenue lined with trees. Then, in the nineteenth century, it was developed into an arcaded shopping street offering English, French, and German luxury goods.</p>
<p>In building <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, <name type="pname">Peter the Great</name> had envisioned not only a city with the grandeur of <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
sailles</name>, but one also reminiscent of <name type="place">Amsterdam</name>, another great commercial port. He had especially admired the Dutch city's new series of concentric canals bordered by tree-lined promenades and unbro-<lb/>
ken rows of town houses, and he had left orders in <date when="1716">1716</date> that, while he was away with the army, a similar
<pb n="220"/>
<pb n="220" type="orig"/>
series of canals was to be laid out on Vasilevsky Island. Upon his return two years later he found that the canals were too small to be navigable. They were therefore filled in, and this part of the city acquired instead a uniform grid of streets.</p>
<p>As <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> became more cosmopolitan, the aristocracy no longer came reluctantly, but gladly forsook their estates for this northern capital with its whirl of social life centered upon the court and the imperial family. A number of Italian architects were commissioned to work alongside the Russian archi-<lb/>
tects to build palaces and otherwise embellish the city. <name type="pname">Bartolomeo Rastrelli</name> designed the Winter Palace, now part of the Hermitage Museum, and several other grandiose structures in the Rococo style. Later in the century, under <name type="pname">Catherine</name> the Great, the Neoclassicism associated with the French Enlightenment prevailed over this more flamboyant architectural idiom.</p>
<p>In her inaugural year of <date when="1762">1762</date>, <name type="pname">Catherine the Great</name>, extolled for having found a city of wood and left one of stone, formed the Commission for the Masonry Construction of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>. In keeping with the forceful role of government in controlling the development of <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name>, rules were codi-<lb/>
fied to ensure architectural conformity of building heights and facades.</p>
<p>The elegance of the Russian capital under <name type="pname">Catherine the Great</name> lay in the ordered grandeur that resulted from these controls as well as in the city's wide modern streets. It was also apparent in a host of decorative details: wrought-iron grilles and gates, rail-<lb/>
ings and lampposts, trees and statues. Under <name type="pname">Czars Alexander I</name> and <name type="pname">Nicholas I</name>, the talented architect <name type="pname">Carlo Rossi</name> (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>) built Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace, one of the world's largest squares and most impressive public spaces (fig. 6.45). Defined by the curving arms of his General Staff Building, which forms a hemicycle on its southern side, the square is given a central focus by the 154-<lb/>
foot- (47-meter-) tall <name type="pname">Alexander Column</name> of polished red Finnish granite, believed to be the largest single stone ever cut.</p>

<p>By the nineteenth century, <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> had become a pleasure capital for the rich. With its uni-<lb/>
versity and Academies of Arts and Sciences, its daily spectacle of carriages and shoppers along Nevsky Prospekt, its theaters and ballet, its German private schools and French restaurants, it was, for those who could afford it, an extremely agreeable and cosmo-<lb/>
politan milieu. Although no one was more aware of the repressive terror that undergirded the city darkly, the poet <name type="pname">Alexander Pushkin</name> (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>) gave delight-<lb/>
ed voice to its violent gaiety, its regimented design, and its military spectacle in <hi rend="italic">The Bronze Horseman</hi>.</p>
<p>The masters of the modern socialist state who succeeded the czars who built <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> found its grand design congenial.

veyed by its public sculpture&#x2014;all these brilliantly served as the model that <name type="place">Russia</name>'s twentieth-century Communist rulers appropriated in the planning of <name type="place">Moscow</name> and other cities where they wished to pro-<lb/>
claim both doctrinaire political authority and a con-<lb/>
servative modernity.</p>
<p>By contrast, monumental planning in a sym-<lb/>
bolic sense held small appeal to the shapers of a dem-<lb/>
ocratic country whose fundamental goal was the pursuit of immediate wealth through free enterprise. The opportunities inherent in a seemingly limit-<lb/>
less supply of land and the hardships attendant upon occupying it were such that practicality, not pomp, was the order of the day in colonial <name type="place">America</name>. Only when freedom from British rule was achieved did the founders of the new United States, supported in their aesthetic ideals by the presence in their country of French allies following the war for independence, commission an architect from <name type="place">France</name>, Pierre L'En-<lb/>
fant, to prepare a plan for its new capital of <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington, D.C.</name> (see fig. 6.54). As we shall see, this initial exercise in American urban grandeur was confined to this one city and was only fully realized in the twen-<lb/>
tieth century. For the most part the serviceable grid employed by Spanish colonial settlers proved of equal merit to the British, whose cities became the models for the western expansion of the United States of <name type="place">America</name> after independence was achieved.</p>

<p>The European arrival in <name type="place">America</name> had profound con-<lb/>
sequences for landscape design. Sixteenth- and sev-<lb/>
enteenth-century explorers and colonists, whose motives were primarily economic, sought wealth in the form of ore, minerals, timber, and other natural resources. In appropriating a new continent, they had scant regard for the customs, ritual centers, and atti-<lb/>
tudes toward nature of the native occupants, the traces of whose presence within the landscape were by and large effaced. Spanish, Dutch, French, and Eng-<lb/>
lish traders and settlers came, some to build towns and farm the land, others to convert souls, trap ani-<lb/>
mals, or mine gold and silver. Although all of these European cultures left their mark, the two principal ones to imprint the American landscape in design terms were the Spanish and the English.</p>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Spanish Colonial Settlements</hi></head>
<p>The first European power to establish settlements in the Americas, <name type="place">Spain</name> began its colonizing activities immediately following <name type="pname">Christopher Columbus</name>'s momentous discovery. At first, when it was still believed that Columbus's landfall had occurred in the Indies, government-sponsored expeditions were moti-<lb/>
vated purely by the desire for trade and the appro-<lb/>
priation of riches. But the dimensions and natural resources of a vast continent gradually revealed them-<lb/>
selves. By <date when="1550">1550</date>, Spanish explorers had ventured from Cuba north to the peninsula they named <name type="place">La Florida</name>, continuing west as far as present-day <name type="place">Arkansas</name> and north along the eastern seaboard of what is now the United States. At the same time, adventurers depart-<lb/>
ing from <name type="place">Mexico City</name> traveled overland into the arid lands that became <name type="place">Texas</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, and <name type="place">Arizona</name> and by sea up the Pacific coast to the more verdant region that is now <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place">Oregon</name>. Tales of mythical cities and magical places like the Fountain of Youth and Diamond Mountain were discredited one by one, and by the first decade of the sixteenth century, it was clear that if wealth was to be gained, <name type="place">Spain</name> would have to subjugate this vast territory and build an empire based not on fabulous finds, but rather on the hard work of farming, ranching, and mining. Laying claim to the entire North American continent, <name type="place">Spain</name> began its colonization efforts.</p>
<p>The Spanish strategy of conquest was based upon three distinct types of settlement: the mission; the military <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>, or fort; and the civilian <hi rend="italic">pueblo or villa</hi>, as towns were variously called depending upon their size and importance. The missionary spear-<lb/>
headed the campaign to convert native peoples to Catholicism and Spanish cultural mores. The soldier manned the <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi> and served as the initial secular intermediary with native peoples, protecting the mis-<lb/>
sion and settlement from hostile invasion while estab-<lb/>
lishing contacts with friendly tribes. The colonist came in their wake, building the <hi rend="italic">pueblo</hi>, establishing civil law, and developing the regional economy.</p>
<p>The Spanish government issued explicit instruc-<lb/>
tions for the layout of these new towns, at first on a case-by-case basis. As settlements multiplied, how-<lb/>
ever, colonial administrators found it necessary to cod-<lb/>
ify their planning prescriptions in a royal ordinance called the <hi rend="italic">Recopilaci&#x00F3;n de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, which <name type="pname">Philip II</name> promulgated in <date when="1573">1573</date>. Pragmatic in its objectives and designed to create a simple paradigm that could be easily followed by architecturally inexperienced men in remote lands, the <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi> ignored the innovative urban schemes of contemporary late Renaissance planners, opting instead for the ancient Roman formula for mil-<lb/>
itary encampments and new towns as set forth by <name type="pname">Vit-<lb/>
ruvius</name> around 30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.e.</hi> and summarized by <name type="pname">Alberti</name> in his fifteenth-century treatise <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi>. In this way, the orthogonal streets and central forum of the ancient colonial city became the plaza-centered grid settlement of <name type="place">Spanish America</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n15"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">15</hi></hi></ref></p>
<p>After the colonists had selected an appropriately healthful site and performed the required rituals&#x2014;usually the saying of mass&#x2014;they marked off a rec-<lb/>
tangular area for the town and built the protective <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>. Their next task was to construct a water sup-<lb/>
ply and irrigation system and to lay out and allot fields outside the town. Then they began filling in its out-<lb/>
lines, first reserving a central space for a plaza of rec-<lb/>
tangular proportions, its recommended length, according to the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi>, being at least one and a half times its width inasmuch as "this proportion is the best for festivals in which horses are used." Whereas, as dis-<lb/>
cussed in Chapter One, the plazas of the Native Amer-<lb/>
ican pueblos were cosmologically aligned according to religious custom with each side facing one of the cardinal directions, Spanish colonial plazas had each corner pointing in a cardinal direction because the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> proclaimed that this prevented undue exposure "to the four principal winds." Four main thorough-<lb/>
fares ran from the middle of each side of the plaza across the length and breadth of the town, and the borders of the plaza were defined by secondary streets. The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> directed that other streets be laid out "con-<lb/>
secutively around the plaza." This injunction almost invariably resulted in a checkerboard or grid pattern. This grid layout was useful for parceling real estate among the settlers of the <hi rend="italic">pueblo</hi>. At the same time, it
<pb n="222"/>
<pb n="222" type="orig"/>
asserted symbolically the authority of the crown over both the settlers and the native population.</p>
<p>Building lots around the plaza were reserved for administrative and other public purposes as well as for shops and dwellings for merchants. The remaining lots in this location were to be distributed by lottery, and the crown held those not distributed for future allocation. It was recommended that the main church be freestanding, sited in an elevated location, and fur-<lb/>
nished with its own adjacent plaza. The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> further enjoined those responsible for laying out the town to reserve outside the palisade a common large enough so that if the town grew "there would always be suf-<lb/>
ficient space for its inhabitants to find recreation and for cattle to pasture without encroaching upon pri-<lb/>
vate property."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> instructed town planners to give the plaza and the four main streets diverging from it arcades "for these are a great convenience for those who resort thither for trade." In <name type="place">Santa Fe</name>, <name type="place">New Mex-<lb/>
ico</name>, and in other Spanish colonial settlements one may still find sidewalks around the plaza sheltered by <hi rend="italic">por-<lb/>
tales</hi>, or porticoes, more rustic in character but nev-<lb/>
ertheless derived from those found along the principal thoroughfares of ancient Roman and Renaissance cities (see fig. 6.40). These <hi rend="italic">portales</hi> sometimes exten-<lb/>
ded along the four principal streets as well as along the eight streets running from the corners of the plaza. If the town planners followed the injunction set forth in the colonial ordinance, the <hi rend="italic">portales</hi> at the corner streets would not obstruct the street crossing, being arranged so that "the sidewalks of the street can evenly join those of the plaza." Particularly after native uprisings made their overseers wary, settlers were directed to fortify the houses around the plaza.</p>
<p>In practice, there were deviations from the rules for town planning set forth in <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, but their intentions were honored widely throughout <name type="place">Spain</name>'s two hundred years of North American colo-<lb/>
nization. The Spanish "old towns" of several con-<lb/>
temporary cities reflect this heritage, later emphasized by the neo-Spanish-Colonial architecture of many buildings in southern <name type="place">California</name> and throughout the American Southwest. Thus we find at the beginning of the eighteenth century, when new forms of plan-<lb/>
ning inspired by French practice and Italian precedents were changing the appearance of European cities, that such <hi rend="italic">pueblos</hi> as <name type="place">San Antonio</name>, <name type="place">Texas</name>; <name type="place">Santa Fe</name>, <name type="place">New Mexico</name>; and <name type="place">Los Angeles</name>, <name type="place">California</name>, were being laid out as grid cities with a central plaza.</p>

<p><name type="place">England</name>'s two first American settlements&#x2014;Jamestown, <name type="place">Virginia</name> (<date when="1607">1607</date>), and <name type="place">Plymouth</name>, <name type="place">Massa-<lb/>
chusetts</name> (<date when="1620">1620</date>)&#x2014;were laid out in a regular fashion as fortified villages within palisaded enclosures. Because of the extreme hardships their settlers endured in inhospitable locations, these villages did not develop into significant towns, much less cities. The colonial governors&#x2014;or the proprietors in the case of the townships of <name type="place">New England</name>&#x2014;who laid out subse-<lb/>
quent settlements acquired land-planning experience that enabled their communities to succeed better. This planning occurred on a regional scale inasmuch as lands granted by crown charter were distributed to colonists in the form of nucleated farming com-<lb/>
munities resembling European villages where farm-<lb/>
ers lived and went into the surrounding countryside to tend their fields.</p>
<p>However, in a land-rich country occupied by independent-minded people already of a migratory disposition, decentralizing forces were immediately at work. Plantation owners who grew tobacco in <name type="place">Vir-<lb/>
ginia</name> and <name type="place">Maryland</name> succeeded in shipping it from their own wharves in spite of the protests of gover-<lb/>
nors who wanted to consolidate colonial trade in port towns; the crown proclamations designating locations for these would-be towns were more than once repealed under pressure. In <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, following the pacification of the native inhabitants and the fail-<lb/>
ure of the first efforts to perform the work of agri-<lb/>
culture and animal husbandry in common, <name type="pname">Governor William Bradford</name> (<date when="1590">1590</date>&#x2013;<date when="1657">1657</date>), the English Puritan who settled and guided the <name type="place">Plymouth Colony</name> for thirty years, found that in order to tend their stocks of cattle the colonists were taking up residence upon their "great lots," the outlying fields allocated to them. He lamented their desertion of "the town, in which they lived compactly until now," and feared that this population dispersal "will be the ruine of <name type="place">New-Eng-<lb/>
land</name>, at least of the Churches of God ther."<ref target="#CH6-n16"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">16</hi></hi></ref></p>

<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="place">New England</name> Townships</hi></head>
<p>In spite of <name type="pname">Bradford</name>'s fears, the settlement of the older parts of <name type="place">New England</name> by groups of proprietors who were tied to one another by common religious belief, kinship, and economic interest did result in a village-<lb/>
centered occupancy of the land unlike that of the scat-<lb/>
tered farmsteads that later became the dominant pattern as the American frontier moved west. For these reasons as well as for security and adherence to tradition, most early <name type="place">New England</name> settlers lived in dis-<lb/>
tinctively defined communities, even as some were dispersing because their agricultural domains and greater opportunities lay at a distance.</p>
<p>Today many of these villages and the towns that grew from them constitute a cherished part of the American landscape. They vary in form but fall roughly into three basic types: "linear" towns such as <name type="place">Salem</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>; compact "square and gridded"
<pb n="223"/>
<pb n="223" type="orig"/>
communities such as <name type="place">Cambridge</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, and <name type="place">New Haven</name>, <name type="place">Connecticut</name>; and "organic" settlements such as <name type="place">Exeter</name>, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>; <name type="place">Woodstock</name>, <name type="place">Ver-<lb/>
mont</name>; and <name type="place">Boston</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>.</p>
<p>Historic <name type="place">Salem</name>, or its Indian place name, Nehum-kek, by which it was known to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Bay Colony settlers, consists of a single irregular street running along high ground between the North and South Rivers. Branching off at intervals on either side of this spine, short streets lead to one or the other river. Along its north side lies the town common, now lined with handsome brick houses.</p>
<p><name type="place">New Haven</name> was settled in <date when="1638">1638</date> as a nine-square grid&#x2014;that is, a square composed of nine blocks, each measuring 825 feet (251.5 meters) square&#x2014;fitted between two streams entering a harbor on the north shore of Long Island Sound (fig. 6.46). The central square, reserved as a green to be held in common, thus constitutes one-ninth of the town, an unusual amount of public space for that period, even in <name type="place">New England</name> where commons were an important feature of town planning. The meetinghouse, the central institution of the religiously ruled <name type="place">New England</name> com-<lb/>
munity, was always given pride of place in any plan-<lb/>
ning scheme, being located atop a prominent topographical elevation or, in the case of <name type="place">New Haven</name> and many other towns, adjacent to, or within, the cen-<lb/>
tral common. Outside the town boundaries lay the fields, which were typically laid out as long narrow strips of land and parceled to proprietors by lottery or some other equitable means. In this suburban zone were additional common lands reserved as cattle pas-<lb/>
tures and timber lands. As <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s population expanded, its green was bisected, with three churches occupying one half, while the other half remained as open public space. In addition, each of its eight remaining blocks was subdivided into four smaller blocks as townsmen surrendered for houses the areas reserved for garden plots. Houses also lined the radial thoroughfares leading from the boundaries of the nine-square grid to the waterfront and to the fields, for at its inception <name type="place">New Haven</name> had attracted more settlers from <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> than the originally planned number of 250. The town's importance increased when, in <date when="1717">1717</date>, the newly founded Yale Col-<lb/>
lege was moved from Saybrook to one of the blocks adjacent to the green.</p>
<p>The foresight demonstrated in <name type="place">New Haven</name>'s planning and that of other <name type="place">New England</name> towns does not entirely account for their scenic character. The combination of site and architecture, the latter a prod-<lb/>
uct of several generations of thoughtfully erected buildings using a limited range of visually pleasing materials, produced the townscape that is admired today wherever it has not been sacrificed to meet the needs of the automobile. The ordered serenity of these towns, which are often nestled in the folds of the glaciated <name type="place">New England</name> landscape with its natu-<lb/>
rally picturesque ponds and hills, provides modern vacationers with a glimpse of an earlier <name type="place">America</name> that is still capable of stirring emotions both patriotic and nostalgic. Save for a few well-tended historic sites, there is little evidence of the rude and cramped houses of the first settlers. Instead, especially in towns where historic preservation is fueled by sufficient afflu-<lb/>
ence, one finds a harmony of later architectural styles. The Neoclassicism favored by the builders of the young republic is seen in columned porticoes and broad pediments, while nearby the turreted solidity of neo-Romanesque rusticated stone betokens the prosperity of the victorious Union after the Civil War when manufacturing wealth made possible the fur-<lb/>
ther architectural adornment of this part of the coun-<lb/>
try. But sadly missing are most of the elms that, before the twentieth-century blight of Dutch elm disease, lifted their graceful canopies over village greens, college campuses, and roadways.</p>

<p>This generally satisfying townscape is the result of a consensual attitude on the part of the inhabi-<lb/>
tants regarding those elements that collectively por-<lb/>
tray community. Perhaps more than elsewhere in the United States, one apprehends in the physiognomy of the <name type="place">New England</name> town American republican polit-<lb/>
ical values. Not surprisingly, the nineteenth-century French student of democracy Alexis de Tocqueville, in tracing the modern origins of this experiment in human governance, emphasized the formative influ-<lb/>
<pb n="224"/>
<pb n="224" type="orig"/>
ence of the colonial <name type="place">New England</name> township. But underlying this expression of a democratic social structure was a basic Puritan one that had envisioned a controlled hierarchical ordering of the town.<ref target="#CH6-n17"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">17</hi></hi></ref> If not prescribed in the manner of the Spanish <hi rend="italic">Laws of the Indies</hi>, this paradigm did have an ex post facto cod-<lb/>
ification in an anonymous and less detailed docu-<lb/>
ment entitled "The Ordering of Towns." It presupposed townships 6 square miles (9.7 square kilometers) in area, which were to be arranged in six concentric zones around a central meetinghouse, with outlying lands held as commons in the manner of English villages before the enclosure movement. The allotment was to be in accordance with "the con-<lb/>
dition of mankind," or according to social and eco-<lb/>
nomic status, with the fifth ring of settlement having the largest and most desirable parcels consisting of 30 to 40 acres of arable land, woodlot, and meadow.</p>
<p>In spite of the lament of <name type="pname">Governor Bradford</name> and sermons by divines such as Cotton Mather castigat-<lb/>
ing land-hungry "outlivers," those who settled more than half a mile distant from the meetinghouse, this strongly nucleated ideal was destined to be modified as the first settlers began to produce surplus livestock for sale to newcomers and the need for additional lands grew apace. More and more outlying land became owner-occupied as the commodities it pro-<lb/>
duced engendered trade, and convenience and secu-<lb/>
rity dictated that entrepreneurial settlers take up residence on their properties. Thus, from the begin-<lb/>
ning, commercial forces vied with those that pro-<lb/>
moted compact community settlement. The spatial configuration of the <name type="place">New England</name> town was there-<lb/>
fore the result of the modification of sectarian atti-<lb/>
tudes and the adaptation of the agrarian mores brought from <name type="place">Old England</name> to a new physical, social, and economic environment.</p>

<p>If sectarian fervor combined with an increasingly trade-oriented population characterized the early set-<lb/>

<p>As governor and proprietor of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> under a charter granted by <name type="pname">King Charles II</name> in <date when="1681">1681</date>, <name type="pname">Penn</name> approached the task of colonization as an administrator and businessman. He developed a land distribution program that granted city lots on a basis proportionate to the size of a purchaser's overall land holdings. He sent three commissioners with the first group of settlers, enjoining them to select a healthy and navigable site for the city, which they had located by the summer of <date when="1682">1682</date> on land midway between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers.</p>
<p>The plan <name type="pname">Penn</name> envisioned for his city was one in which uniform streets were to stretch from the country bounds to the water's edge. With <name type="place">London</name>'s Great Fire of <date when="1666">1666</date> still fresh in his memory, he wrote, "Let every house be placed, if the person pleases, in the middle of its plat, as to the breadth of it, that so there may be ground on each side for gardens or orchards, or fields, that it may be a green country town, which will never be burnt, and always be whole-<lb/>
some."<ref target="#CH6-n18"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">18</hi></hi></ref> In this fashion did <name type="pname">Penn</name> enunciate the ideal that homeowning Americans have embraced over the course of three hundred years&#x2014;a freestanding house surrounded by its own plot of land. To assist in the task of laying out the new city, he appointed <name type="pname">Captain Thomas Holme</name> as surveyor general.</p>
<p>With <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s arrival in <date when="1682-10">October 1682</date>, the plan for the city began to take shape under his personal direction. He had Holme draw a gridiron bounded on the east by the Delaware and on the west by the Schuylkill, with a central square at the crossing of its two principal axes, Broad Street and High Street (fig. 6.47). Familiar with <name type="pname">Lincoln</name>'s Inn Fields and Moor-<lb/>
fields&#x2014;open spaces accessible to the general public in <name type="place">London</name>&#x2014;the city's recently developed private res-<lb/>
idential squares, and probably at least one of the sev-<lb/>
eral post-Great Fire plans calling for urban green space, he directed Holme to place a square within each quadrant of the city. <name type="pname">Penn</name> was explicit that they be open to all members of the community, unlike the new <name type="place">London</name> squares, which were reserved for the exclusive use of neighboring property owners.</p>
<p>The public square, along with the freestanding home with its adjacent garden, was <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s important contribution to the future American cityscape, for the
<pb n="225"/>
<pb n="225" type="orig"/>
gridiron plan, punctuated with one or more of these green spaces, became the model that settlers applied almost ubiquitously to new communities as they moved westward. Sometimes occupied by court-<lb/>
houses or other public buildings, such squares every-<lb/>
where denote civic intention and community focus.</p>
<p>As in <name type="place">New Haven</name>, <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s generously scaled blocks became subdivided as row houses were built along narrow streets inserted where gardens had been intended. This happened also in other cities as popu-<lb/>
lation growth accelerated and speculation in urban land increased. Where land speculators platted grids designed to realize a maximum profit from lot sales, the squares of <name type="pname">Penn</name>'s "green country town" were often eliminated or reduced to a single token public space. There existed, however, another important example of American colonial planning in which a gra-<lb/>
cious and livable city&#x2014;Savannah, <name type="place">Georgia</name>&#x2014;was built and maintained over a long period of time according to the intentions of its founder.</p>
</div>
<div type="subsection">
<head><hi rend="smallcaps"><name type="pname">James Oglethorpe's Savannah</name></hi></head>
<p>In <date when="1732">1732</date>, <name type="pname">James Oglethorpe</name> (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785">1785</date>), an English philanthropist and member of Parliament who was interested in prison reform, secured a charter from <name type="pname">King George II</name> for the founding of the colony of <name type="place">Geor-<lb/>
gia</name>. Here he hoped, with a subscription of funds raised from a group of humane aristocrats, to transport incarcerated debtors who wished to seek a fresh start in life as well as persons experiencing religious perse-<lb/>
cution and others eager for economic opportunity. The following year found him working indefatigably alongside the 114 original colonists, supervising the clearing of a large rectangular area of the tall pine for-<lb/>
est where his town was to be laid out along a crescent bend in the Savannah River 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) inland from the sea. A palisade was soon erected and the first houses built even as the terms of property deeds were being defined. These deeds demonstrate the regional scope of <name type="pname">Oglethorpe</name>'s plan, which granted each settler a house lot measuring 60 by 90 feet (18.3 by 27.4 meters), a 5-acre garden plot, and a 44-acre farm, with the stipulation that he must con-<lb/>
struct a house within an eighteen-month period and cultivate at least 10 acres of his outlying farmland.</p>
<p>Like <name type="pname">Penn</name>, <name type="pname">Oglethorpe</name> was familiar with the pattern of residential development in <name type="place">London</name> whereby groups of houses were being built specula-<lb/>
tively around green squares, a process that the pros-<lb/>
perity of <name type="place">Georgian England</name> had accelerated. He was probably also familiar with the plans for <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> and <name type="place">New Haven</name>. But the original and ingenious fea-<lb/>
ture of his plan for Savannah was the concept of the ward as a group of forty house lots laid out as four tithings," or blocks of ten houses each, with the blocks ranged beside a central green, next to two sides of which two large lots were reserved for churches and other public and semipublic buildings such as stores. Savannah therefore was not to be laid out, like <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> or <name type="place">New Haven</name>, as an urban grid with one or more spaces exempted from develop-<lb/>
ment; rather the grid was to be formed additively by ward units, each with a green square in the center. This meant that, as the city grew, it could never become a solid urban mass because it would always have an open green square within each new ward (figs. 6.48, 6.49).</p>

While Puritans may have had little interest in ornamental horticulture, the settlers sent over by the Dutch West India Company remembered from their homeland such small intricate late Renais-<lb/>
sance gardens with <hi rend="italic">parterre</hi> beds, topiary, arbors, and fountains as are seen in the garden pattern books of <name type="pname">Hans Vredeman de Vries</name> and <name type="pname">Jan van der Groen</name> (see figs. 6.2 and 6.3). <name type="pname">Peter Stuyvesant</name>, the Director Gen-<lb/>
eral of the Dutch West India Company in <name type="place">New Ams-<lb/>
terdam</name> between <date when="1646">1646</date> to <date when="1664">1664</date>, had, for example, next to his residence on the Battery in Manhattan a gar-<lb/>
den with <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and fruit trees arranged around a simple axis. Most of the Dutch colonists he oversaw, however, practiced a utilitarian horticulture, and early views of the island show several <hi rend="italic">bouweries</hi>, as they called their small farms with orchards.</p>
<p>Promotional tracts aimed at recruiting colonists extolled the natural bounty of the land, making <name type="place">America</name> sometimes appear as a second Eden. In <name type="place">Vir-<lb/>
ginia</name> and the Carolinas, where climate and soil were especially hospitable for gardening and novel speci-<lb/>
mens abundant, settlers combined in their gardens the plants grown in their native <name type="place">England</name> with botan-<lb/>
ical discoveries from their new homeland. Like colonists elsewhere, their interest was primarily in plants that could nourish them or cure their ills. <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, the colonial capital <name type="pname">Governor Francis Nicholson</name> (<date when="1655">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738">1738</date>) and his successor <name type="pname">Alexander Spotswood</name> (<date when="1676">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740">1740</date>) planned with a degree of ele-<lb/>
gance beginning in <date when="1699">1699</date>, became an important cen-<lb/>
ter for the development of gardening in <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="pname">Nicholson</name>, when he was governor of <name type="place">Maryland</name>, had laid out Annapolis in a novel manner for colonial <name type="place">America</name>. His plan for that city featured two large cir-<lb/>
cles and radial steets intersecting grid blocks. Now he brought his planning experience to bear on <name type="place">Williams-<lb/>
burg</name>, achieving a dignified urban design with the Capitol at the eastern end of its principal axis&#x2014;Duke of Gloucester Street&#x2014;and the newly founded Col-<lb/>
lege of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> at the western. At a right angle to Duke of Gloucester Street, a broad grassy swath known as the palace green led to the site of the Governor's Palace.</p>

</figure>
<p>When Spotswood came to occupy this mansion in <date when="1710">1710</date>, he continued the axis of the palace green in the gardens he laid out behind it and encouraged as the mark of genteel civilization the planting of orchards and gardens here and at the college (fig. 6.50). An intelligent site planner, Spotswood also helped place several buildings in the new town in relationship to open spaces and view lines. Unfortu-<lb/>
nately, he abused an informal understanding he had with another prominent colonist, <name type="pname">John Custis</name> (<date when="1678">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1749">1749</date>), when he cut down several more trees than anticipated on the latter's property in order to open up a "visto," probably that along the palace green. He also aroused the ire of the House of Burgesses when he transformed the ravine behind the Governor's Palace into a series of elaborate terraces and built a rectangular canal connected to a fish pond and a large park. The legislators balked at the earth-moving and excavation costs incurred in building "the Fish-Pond and Falling gardens," putting to an end Spotwood's landscaping efforts at <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, but not before he had set the tone for its future development.</p>
<p>In the affluent western half of the town, colonists laid out utilitarian gardens that were, nev-<lb/>
ertheless, modeled on those of the Governor's Palace, their straight gravel paths flanked by topiary after the fashion established a few years earlier in the royal gar-<lb/>
dens of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> and those of the country estates designed during their English reign (see figs. 6.10&#x2013;6.12). In his garden Custis displayed some of the botanical specimens that were then arousing scien-<lb/>
tific curiosity as a lively transatlantic seed exchange began to occur. Nearby plantation owners, notably <name type="pname">William Byrd</name> and his son, <name type="pname">William Byrd II</name>, both mem-<lb/>
bers of <name type="place">London</name>'s Royal Society, were active in recruit-<lb/>
ing such naturalists as <name type="pname">William Banister</name> (<date when="1654">1654</date>&#x2013;<date when="1692">1692</date>) to come to <name type="place">Virginia</name> to study the flora of the region, and their activities also promoted the use of native plants in town gardens. The Byrds' Westover planta-<lb/>
tion served as a laboratory for botanical experiments in which Banister, who also had his own botanical garden, assisted until his untimely death on a collect-<lb/>
ing expedition with the elder Byrd.</p>

<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century, <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>, like <name type="pname">Charleston</name>, had become an impor-<lb/>
tant center for the transmission of botanical knowl-<lb/>
edge among plantation owners, town gardeners, and interested parties back home in <name type="place">England</name>. Many of <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>'s gardens were reconstructed by the Rockefeller Foundation beginning in <date when="1926">1926</date> (see Chap-<lb/>
ter Fifteen). The landscape architect in charge, <name type="pname">Arthur Shurcliff</name>, researched the Dutch-English landscape style of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> prevailing at the time of the town's foundation, studying existing <name type="place">Virginia</name> site plans and archaeological remains. He subsequently created geometric <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi> and topiary as well as a holly maze in the same configuration as the one of yew at Hampton Court.</p>
<p>The most splendid gardens of the colonial period were those belonging to wealthy southern plantation owners who enjoyed the benefits of a mild climate and were able to employ a large workforce of slaves in garden construction. In the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury, as <name type="place">Virginia</name> and the Carolinas became the locus of much botanical activity, these southern gardens displayed many plants new to horticulture.</p>
<p>Along the James River in <name type="place">Virginia</name>, tobacco gen-<lb/>
erated the wealth that enabled great estate holders to landscape their properties with graceful terraces lead-<lb/>
ing to river landings, the usual means of approach to a plantation mansion, although they also dignified their inland entrance drives by planting long <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi> of trees on either side. <name type="pname">Carter</name>'s Grove, the plantation begun in <date when="1751">1751</date> by <name type="pname">Carter Burwell</name>, was ambitiously landscaped in this fashion. Near Charleston, <name type="place">South Carolina</name>, where rice and indigo were the basis of a prosperous colonial economy, the terraced slopes of the gardens above the Ashley and Cooper Rivers were called falls. Many of the once-great gardens that lined the banks of these two rivers succumbed to the Amer-<lb/>
ican Revolution and the Civil War as well as to natu-<lb/>
ral disasters and the misfortunes of time. There remains, however, one excellent representative exam-<lb/>
ple, Middleton Place, which is open to the public. Descendants of the original owner, <name type="pname">Henry Middle-<lb/>
ton</name>, have restored the gardens their ancestor laid out in <date when="1741">1741</date> beside the Ashley River (figs. 6.51, 6.52).</p>
<p>Although it is an eighteenth-century garden, Middleton Place does not stand within the tradition of contemporary English landscape design, but rather harks back to the earlier style of <name type="pname">William</name> and <name type="pname">Mary</name> exemplified at <name type="place">Williamsburg</name>. From the Charleston Road on the inland side a long drive becomes a sweep-<lb/>
ing oval turnaround, carrying the visitor past the sta-<lb/>
bles to the point where the main house once stood. This principal axis continues opposite the house site, becoming the spine of the gardens' most original fea-<lb/>
ture, the falls, a series of five gracefully bowed grassy terraces, the curves of which are echoed in the pair of lakes that form the shape of a butterfly where the garden meets the plantation's low-lying rice fields and the causeway leading to the river landing.</p>

tation slaves working for ten years in the nonagricul-<lb/>
tural season built the impressive green falls and the geometric gardens to the north of the entry lawn, as well as the drives, <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;es</hi>, ponds, and long rectangular canal. <name type="pname">Newman</name> fitted the gardens into a triangular
<pb n="228"/>

space defined by the edge of the entry lawn, the canal, and the river; they originally contained box-bordered <hi rend="italic">parterres</hi>, a bowling green, and a mount for viewing the elegantly ornamented landscape and surround-<lb/>
ing marshland and rice paddies. A sophisticated means of controlling the alternating water levels required for rice culture also maintained the surface height of Middleton's Butterfly Ponds and tidal mill pond.</p>

<p>Another century was to pass before the descen-<lb/>
dants of the slaves who had built Middleton Place would be emancipated. It is sobering to remember that the nation's founding father and first president was also a plantation owner whose garden was cre-<lb/>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">Mount Vernon</hi></head>
<p><name type="pname">George Washington</name> (<date when="1732">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799">1799</date>) was a <name type="place">Virginia</name> landowner whose prosperity depended upon rev-<lb/>
enues derived from agriculture and livestock. His home at Mount Vernon, high above the Potomac, was one of five farms he worked on the banks of the river. As a son of the Enlightenment, he followed with keen interest not only those developments in botan-<lb/>
ical science that were of benefit to agronomy but also the exciting discoveries that were enriching the palette of ornamental horticulture. Although he lacked <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>'s firsthand knowledge of contem-<lb/>
porary English and French landscape design, he owned engravings by <name type="pname">Claude Lorrain</name> and responded aesthetically to the Picturesque and sublime, which he found at hand in the unspoiled beauties of the American scene. With no more professional advice than that found in his garden books, including a copy of <name type="pname">Batty Langley</name>'s <hi rend="italic">New Principles of Gardening</hi>, he fash-<lb/>
ioned the grounds around his Mount Vernon resi-<lb/>
dence and took considerable pleasure in growing his fruit trees, planting evergreen and flowering shrubs, and propagating plants in his greenhouse.</p>
<p>The drawing by <name type="pname">Samuel Vaughan</name> (<date when="1787">1787</date>) of <name type="place">Washington</name>'s plan for laying out the grounds at Mount Vernon shows the house with its broad veranda facing the river (fig. 6.53). To the rear of the house, a circular drive outlines a round lawn, and a pair of serpentine, symmetrical drives define a large pear- or bell-shaped bowling green before converg-<lb/>
ing in the drive leading to the highway. Two "wilder-<lb/>
nesses" at its western end and a surrounding belt of trees, many of them native species&#x2014;crab apple, poplar, locust, pine, maple, dogwood, black gum, ash, elm, holly, mulberry, hemlock, magnolia, laurel, wil-<lb/>
low, sassafras, linden, arbor vitae, aspen, pine&#x2014;gave further definition and enclosure to the bowling green. A conservatory housed his collection of rare botani-<lb/>
cal specimens.</p>
<p>On opposite sides of the bowling green <name type="place">Wash-<lb/>
ington</name> placed two gardens, one for flowers and the other for vegetables. He laid these out as geometric beds and screened them from the more informally composed adjacent grounds with walls, curving their ends in order to mediate the visual transition between their lines and those of the serpentine walks. In addi-<lb/>
tion to planting thickly the space in between the gar-<lb/>
den walls and the bowling green, he constructed two earthen mounds next to the entrance drive, setting weeping willows beside them while leaving open a view of the distant woods.</p>
<p>Two groves of trees flanked the house on the east, and here he turned the sloping grounds into a deer park and planted low-growing shrubs so as not to interrupt the vista framed by his classical portico of rising hills ranging into the blue distance. A ha-ha, or continuous ditch, served as an invisible fence, thus preventing deer from grazing adjacent to the house. In keeping with contemporary practice for rural bur-<lb/>
ial places, <name type="place">Washington</name> set the family tomb on this ele-<lb/>
vated ground overlooking the river.</p>

eastern view drew rhapsodic praise from more than one visitor. The ornamental garden and its sur-<lb/>
rounding panoramic scenery were undoubtedly a source of contentment to both Martha and <name type="pname">George Washington</name>. At the same time, practical and scientific horticulture continued to be for him a lively passion. He corresponded with nurserymen and botanists in <name type="place">America</name> and abroad and placed orders for trees, shrubs, and seeds. He visited the gardens of the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> plantsman <name type="pname">John Bartram</name> and the newly established Prince nursery in Flushing, Long Island.</p>
<p><name type="pname">Washington</name> may perhaps be credited as being the father of that important national institution, the American lawn. Another contemporary visitor, <name type="pname">Julian Niemcewicz</name>, a Polish aristocrat, called Mount Ver-<lb/>
non's grass "a green carpet of the most beautiful vel-<lb/>
vet." Niemcewicz also remarked on the beautiful tulip trees (<hi rend="italic">Liriodendron tulipfera</hi>), magnolias (<hi rend="italic">Magnolia vir-<lb/>
giniana</hi>), "the splendid catalpa not yet in flower" and "the <name type="place">New Scotland</name> spruce of beautiful dark green, and many other trees and shrubs, covered with flow-<lb/>
ers of different hues, planted so as to produce the best of color-effects." He ended his encomium, written in <date when="1798">1798</date>, by declaring that "the whole plantation, the gar-<lb/>
den, and the rest prove well that a man born with nat-<lb/>
ural taste may guess a beauty without having ever seen its model."<ref target="#CH6-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>Unable on political grounds to choose as a national capital one among the colonial cities of the thirteen states that formed the original federation, the founders of the new nation decided for reasons both practical and symbolical to create an entirely new city in the sparsely settled countryside bordering <name type="place">Maryland</name> and <name type="place">Virginia</name>. Shortly after Congress enacted the legislation that created a federal district in <date when="1790">1790</date>, <name type="pname">Washington</name> retained Pierre Charles L'Enfant (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>) to pre-<lb/>
pare a plan for it (fig. 6.54). L'Enfant, a French artist and architect who had come to <name type="place">America</name> as a volunteer in the cause of the Revolution, had risen to the rank of major in the Corps of Engineers. After the war, he stayed on to find work in the new United States. It was a time when other young French professionals, deprived of their former <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> patrons by the revolution in <name type="place">France</name>, were emigrating to the bur-<lb/>
geoning eastern seaboard cities in this country Upon hearing of the decision to establish a new capital, L'En-<lb/>
fant, who was designing and remodeling mansions in <name type="place">New York City</name>, wrote to <name type="pname">Washington</name> offering to draw up a plan for the new city. In accepting the French archi-<lb/>
tect's offer, <name type="pname">Washington</name>, whether he realized this irony or not, was, in effect, importing a planning vision expressive of autocratic monarchy as the paradigm for a new kind of national grandeur based upon the prin-<lb/>
ciples of revolution and the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>L'Enfant had, in fact, spent eight of his boyhood years at <name type="place">Versailles</name> where his father, Pierre L'Enfant, was employed in decorating the building of the Min-<lb/>
istry of War. He had subsequently enrolled in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in <name type="place">Paris</name> and was therefore aware of all the developments, both royal and private, to embellish that capital. His first assignment from <name type="pname">Washington</name> was to assess the topo-<lb/>
graphic qualities of the site, and in accordance with the theory of <name type="pname">Dezallier d'Argenville</name>, the plan that he proposed did not imply the arbitrary imposition of a preconceived scheme upon nature, but rather used existing landforms as the basis of design. In particu-<lb/>
lar, <name type="pname">Jenkin</name>'s Hill, the area's highest eminence, was sin-<lb/>
gled out as the "pedestal waiting for a superstructure," the suggested site for the United States Capitol in the memorandum that L'Enfant submitted with his final version of the plan in <date when="1791-08">August 1791</date>.<ref target="#CH6-n20"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">20</hi></hi></ref></p>

<p>L'Enfant's plan disposed buildings and streets in a manner that brought the various elements of the union&#x2014;executive and legislature as well as the sev-<lb/>
eral states&#x2014;into a subtly conceived iconographic fed-<lb/>
eration.<ref target="#CH6-n21"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">21</hi></hi></ref> Like <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>, who had also drawn up a plan for the new capital in <date when="1791">1791</date>, L'Enfant pro-<lb/>
posed a street grid. But instead of <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s uniform grid, L'Enfant's was overlaid with another diagram consisting of squares and circles connected by diago-<lb/>
nal avenues. The plan was comparable to that of L'En-<lb/>
fant's boyhood town of <name type="place">Versailles</name>, a grid punctuated with squares and set within a framework of super-<lb/>
imposed diagonal axes.</p>
<p>Although the urban scale fostered by an ambi-<lb/>
tious monarch at <name type="place">Versailles</name> was expansive, that of <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, was more so. The new capital city set at the edge of a vast continent was proportioned to reflect the the opportunity of abundant untenanted land as well as the ambitions of its founders. The major avenues were 160 feet (49 meters) wide, with 80 feet (24 meters) reserved for the roadbed and 30 feet (9 meters) for flanking walkways. These walk-<lb/>
ways were defined by double rows of trees, and there was an additional 10-foot strip separating the trees from the adjacent building lots on either side.</p>
<p>These great tree-lined avenues were named for the then-existing states and grouped roughly accord-<lb/>
ing to their geography with the northeastern states in the northern part of the district, the mid-Atlantic states in the center and the southern states in the southeastern section. <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Avenue, the cor-<lb/>
ridor linking the Capitol on <name type="pname">Jenkin</name>'s Hill and the Pres-<lb/>
ident's House, which was sited on an alluvial escarpment sloping up from the Potomac, was given pride of place, thereby honoring the importance of that state as host to the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitutional Convention. Similarly, the intersection of <name type="place">New York</name> Avenue with the square in which the President's House was located commemorated <name type="place">New York City</name>'s former status as the capital of the Continental Congress and the site where <name type="pname">Washington</name> took the presidential oath of office.</p>
<p>The Mall (abbreviated from Pall Mall) was described by <name type="pname">L'Enfant</name> as a "grand Avenue, 400 feet in breadth, and about a mile in length, bordered with gardens, ending in a slope from the houses on each side."<ref target="#CH6-n22"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold">22</hi></hi></ref> This Mall, which in L'Enfant's words would give <name type="pname">Washington</name> "a superiority of agreements" over most other cities, was to be the home of "theaters, assembly halls, academies"&#x2014;purpose-built structures catering to the entertainment, social, and intellectual needs of a democratic society. L'Enfant's plan also included Judiciary Square, the site chosen for the Supreme Court, and fifteen other squares. These were to be assigned to the then-existing states (<name type="pname">Ken-<lb/>
tucky</name> and <name type="pname">Tennessee</name> had recently joined the thirteen colonial states that formed the union) with the hope that their citizens would appropriate, through private subscription, funds for their improvement.</p>
<p>In brief, given the equivalent of a blank slate upon which to work, L'Enfant transcended the con-<lb/>
joined garden-town model of his native <name type="place">Versailles</name>, creating in <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, a city with many gar-<lb/>
dens within it. This combination of green openness and urban monumentality constitutes the American capital's uniqueness.</p>
<p>It is clear from the foregoing that cities were devel-<lb/>
oping in a manner that made them physically and conceptually different from their predecessors. They were expanding and becoming ungirdled, their walls torn down, a physical metaphor perhaps for the way in which philosophers were embracing open-ended scientific inquiry. Furthermore, in the eighteenth cen-<lb/>
tury, their cultural contents were enlarged as new institutions were incorporated into the urban fabric. Formerly the province of princes or private universi-<lb/>
ties, botanical and zoological gardens, libraries, muse-<lb/>
ums, theaters, and opera houses were now considered the rightful legacy of the urban bourgeoisie. A fun-<lb/>
damental result of the American and French Revolu-<lb/>
tions was the creation of a sense of popular entitlement. By the nineteenth century, cultural insti-<lb/>
tutions were considered an essential part of the pub-<lb/>
lic domain. One institution, the public park, became an especially important element in the altered social structure of cities. From its inception, one American city, <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, contained many parklike ele-<lb/>
ments; in building Central Park a little over a half cen-<lb/>
tury later <name type="place">New York City</name> spearheaded a movement for the creation of public parks throughout the nation, in which the notion of <hi rend="italic">rus en urbe</hi>, an artful fusion of country and city, was promoted as an essential moral and public health benefit.</p>
<p>In summary, the urban fabric was becoming more loosely woven and of more generous dimen-<lb/>
sions. As cities grew, tore down their walls, and blurred the line between urban and rural, the human attitude toward nature was significantly transformed. The spreading city gradually engulfed the rural coun-<lb/>
tryside, and nature became an increasingly important component within the urban framework. The cre-<lb/>
ation of naturalistic parks, however, did not occur without a cultural shift. That change was becoming apparent in the relaxation of French landscape design norms at the end of the seventeenth century. But to grasp the character of this change more fully, we must turn to eighteenth-century <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
