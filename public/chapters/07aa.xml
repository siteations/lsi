                    contemplated and appreciated rather than nature demanding to be tamed and
                    ordered, was a novel one at the dawn of the eighteenth century. Both poetry and
                    the development of landscape painting as a specific genre stimulated and
                    influenced a growing taste for rural scenery and landscape designs that
                    reflected the mind's sensations and moods.</p>

                    English physicist and mathematician <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Newton</name>
                        (<date when="1642">1642</date>&#x2013;<date when="1727">1727</date>). With
                    the discovery of the optical properties of light, definition of the laws of
                    motion, development of an infinitesimal calculus, and formulation of the law of
                    universal gravitation, <name type="pname">Newton</name> effectively laid the
                    foundations of modern science. What followed was an unprecedented confidence in
                    human reason. <name type="pname">Newton</name> fathered the Enlightenment and
                    was a correspondent and later president of the Royal Society, which promoted
                    open-ended scientific discovery in an era when the universities still taught
                    according to an Aristotelian pedagogy that presupposed the systematization of
                    scholarship within an all-encompassing, self-contained framework.</p>
                <p><name type="pname">Newton</name>'s contemporary <name type="pname">John
                        Locke</name> (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704"
                        >1704</date>) was a philosopher whose vision of epistemology, politics,
                    education, and medicine helped lay the groundwork for a new human psychology as
                    well as for a new empirical approach to science. Taking issue with Descartes's
                    belief in the mind as a repository of innate ideas, he declared that, to the
                    contrary, all knowledge of the world must rest on sensory experience. This
                    concept of the mind as an instrument for inductive reasoning and a theater for
                    personal experience, rather than as a receptacle for revealed Truth and
                    immutable law, had an important effect on garden design in the eighteenth
                    century as landscapes were contrived to furnish the sensate mind with specific
                    mental associations and impressions.</p>
                <p>As a physical manifestation of the intellectual philosophy laid out in <name
                        type="pname">Locke</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Essay Concerning Human
                        Understanding</hi> (<date when="1690">1690</date>), and the consequent
                    authority granted to individual sensibility, the garden assumed a new character
                    and function. Its role as a place of authoritarian power, display, and social
                    entertainment was diminished as it became a place of meditation, reflection, and
                    friendship. <name type="pname">Locke</name> provides the key to understanding
                    the emphasis upon the associative potential of garden scenes in the eighteenth
                    century. As the intellectual tradition of Neoplatonic classicism waned and
                    landscape design based upon the notion of an underlying normative order of
                    harmonic proportion ceased to be influential, the desire to produce stimuli for
                    a wide range of mental experiences and emotions fostered a new kind of garden
                    making. Its orientation toward sensibility, rather than abstract beauty, caused
                    patrons and designers to value ancient architectural styles, ruins,
                    commemorative monuments, and a richly varied natural scenery. These provoked
                    admiration and reflection, induced moral instruction, and created pleasurable
                    surprise.</p>
                <p>The intellectual freedom engendered by <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s fresh
                    examination of the workings of the human mind fostered and supported the
                    contemporary climate of political change. <name type="pname">Locke</name> was
                    taken into the household of <name type="pname">Baron Ashley</name> (later the
                    first earl of Shaftesbury) as a physician. He proved to be an influential
                    confidant of that statesman as well, working toward the goals of increased civil
                    liberty, constitutional monarchy, parliamentary rule, religious toleration,
                    Protestant succession, and mercantile trade. Thus, although the actual gardens
                    of his own day were the<pb n="233"/><pb n="233" type="orig"/>French-inspired
                    ones of the Restoration and the Anglo-Dutch gardens of <name type="pname"
                        >William and Mary</name>, <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s belief in
                    political freedom, together with his seminal ideas on sensory awareness,
                    provided the intellectual soil for the gardens of Georgian England. The result
                    was a more naturalistic style, with architectural and ornamental elements used
                    as images to stimulate ideas of a historical, ethical, partisan, or sentimental
                    nature, thus promoting the proud ideal of the country itself as a kind of
                    libertarian garden.</p>
                <p><name type="pname">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</name> (<date when="1712"
                        >1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">1778</date>), in his philosophical and
                    political discourses on the importance of reverie and the power of the
                    imagination, extended <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s influence. The mind as a
                    self-aware organ, capable of feats of intuition as well as reason, could produce
                    visions of a more perfect human society. Inspired by images of ancient Sparta
                    and republican <name type="place">Rome</name> as well as of his native city of
                    Geneva, he set forth in <hi rend="italic">The Social Contract</hi> (<date
                        when="1762">1762</date>) a doctrine of human equality and political
                    democracy.</p>
                <p>Believing in the innate goodness of "natural man" and in the inspirational
                    character of nature, <name type="pname">Rousseau</name> became a prophet not
                    only for the political revolutionaries who read in him their own social visions,
                    but also of Romanticism. This movement, which gained force at the end of the
                    eighteenth century and extends into our own day, posed a spiritual
                    counterbalance to the scientific rationalism of the Enlightenment. Emotion and
                    visionary intuition as a mode of human perception became as important as thought
                    and rational calculation. <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s philosophy, which
                    enlarged the freedom <name type="pname">Locke</name> had granted the senses, was
                    instrumental in reinvesting classicism with poetic visions of a lost Golden Age.
                    It is understandable, therefore, that the eighteenth-century garden&#x2014;a
                    place particularly congenial to reverie, recollection, reflection, and
                    imaginative participation in an ideal world beyond "corrupt"
                    civilization&#x2014;owed a debt to his theories. Appropriately, it was in the
                    romantically conceived garden of the <name type="pname">Marquis de
                        Girardin</name> at Ermenonville that <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>
                    sought refuge at the end of his life.</p>
                <p><name type="pname">Rousseau</name> was the intellectual heir not only to <name
                        type="pname">Locke</name>, but also to Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of
                    Shaftesbury (<date when="1671">1671</date>&#x2013;<date when="1713"
                    >1713</date>), an Enlightenment writer who, like <name type="pname"
                        >Rousseau</name>, believed in the innate goodness of natural man and of
                    nature. Shaftesbury saw landscapes as having personality; he cried out to the
                    "Genius of the Place,"<ref target="#CH7-n1"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"
                                >1</hi></hi></ref> the spirit that interacts with the human mind,
                    eliciting emotions, fostering perceptions, stimulating both memory and
                    curiosity. Shaftesbury advocated grottoes, cascades, and other dramatically
                    charged landscape forms as a means of stimulating mental associations with
                    nature's mysteries. His thoughts influenced Addison and Pope, writers whose
                    garden theories were influential at the time when a series of emblematically
                    significant English gardens&#x2014;including most notably Stowe and <name
                        type="pname">Castle Howard</name>&#x2014;were being created.</p>
                <p>As the associative potential of gardens to thematically portray a particular
                    ideology became less compelling and the enclosure movement gathered force,
                    English landscape design tradition evolved into the abstractly expressive style
                    of <name type="pname">"Capability" Brown</name> and, subsequently, into the
                    Picturesque style with its Rococo inflection, which proved especially popular in
                        <name type="place">France</name>, where the style's variant of the <hi
                        rend="italic">jardin anglais</hi> was termed the <hi rend="italic">jardin
                        anglo-chinois</hi>. The Picturesque theorists who set themselves in
                    opposition to <name type="pname">Brown</name> engendered a great deal of
                    spirited debate because the eighteenth-century garden remained an arena of
                    aesthetic idealism even after it had become less didactically explicit. The
                    relationship between landscape and political and intellectual philosophy was
                    important not only in <name type="place">Europe</name> but also in the newly
                    formed <name type="place">United States of America</name> where <name
                        type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name> imaginatively took up the task of
                    garden design while also shaping a vision for an agrarian nation of continental
                    dimensions.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most important eighteenth-century minds besides <name type="pname"
                        >Rousseau</name>'s to further the trend toward Romanticism in the West and
                    to anticipate the coming age's commitment to industrial capitalism and democracy
                    were those of the German polymath and poet <name type="pname">Goethe</name> and
                    the seminal English poet <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>. Although both had
                    practical experience in garden design, their influence was more broadly
                    cultural. <name type="pname">Goethe</name> saw nature as a source of
                    experiential ecstasy that could, if carried to excess as was the tendency of his
                    time, be debilitating as well as exhilarating. In <hi rend="italic">Faust Part
                        II</hi> he also anticipated the dark Romanticism implicit in Nietzsche's
                    notion of a Superman. By portraying his famous protagonist in the guise of
                    industrial developer&#x2014;Faust's ultimate quest for experience and ascendance
                    over nature and the rest of humankind&#x2014;<name type="pname">Goethe</name>
                    foresaw the exponential release of new sources of energy and capitalist power
                    that would occur as the Industrial Revolution gained momentum. <name
                        type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s poems also encouraged intense and intimate
                    communion with and reflection upon nature. For <name type="pname"
                        >Wordsworth</name>, love of nature was inevitably conjoined with reverence
                    for the human mind, the noble instrument of Lockean perception, without which
                    nature's marvelous beauty would be as naught. In addition, <name type="pname"
                        >Wordsworth</name> fostered empathy for common humanity, finding simple,
                    honest beauty in the quotidian experience of ordinary lives. Thus, <name
                        type="pname">Goethe</name> and <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> are
                    pivotal, carrying forward into the nineteenth century the strikingly important
                    eighteenth-century concept that "the genius of the place" and human genius, a
                    gift to all mortals, are inextricably allied.</p>

                            <name type="pname">Alexander Pope</name> was the poet most responsible
                        for turning English garden design in a different direction. By his writing
                        and example, Pope actively publicized the style of landscape design favored
                        by the Whig aristocracy and gentry as well as their literary and artistic
                        friends. These Whig landowners, often with Pope's advice, initiated projects
                        that wed English taste for country houses in the architectural style of
                            <name type="pname">Andrea Palladio</name> with English scenery, creating
                        landscapes that attempted to evoke "the genius of the place."</p>
                    <p>Their creation of a new landscape style was less radical, and more

                                type="pname">Pope</name> appealed liked to see himself as a Horace
                            or a Pliny the Younger, a practitioner of an eighteenth-century version
                            of <hi rend="italic">otium</hi>, the use of rural leisure as an
                            intellectual stimulus, when he returned to his estate after a term in
                            Parliament. His sympathy with classical subjects and appreciation of the
                            relaxed relationship that existed between art and nature in Roman times
                            had been nourished by a receptive reading of the ancient poets and
                            statesmen. The agricultural self-sufficiency of Pliny's villas, their
                            function as places of private retirement and social entertainment, their
                            attention to human comfort and scenic prospect&#x2014;all these things
                            inspired an agrarian emphasis in eighteenth-century English gardens.
                            This, in turn, influenced the emblematic character of garden ornament as
                            numerous statues of Ceres, Flora, and Bacchus took up residence in
                            English fields alongside of those tra<pb n="235"/><pb n="235"

                            was the hold exerted by <name type="place">Rome</name> on the

                        <p>Because of this sympathy for the poets of the early Roman Empire, the

                                >England</name> are sometimes called an Augustan Age. In keeping
                            with his self-image as a latter-day Augustan at the moment in history
                            when <name type="place">England</name> was on the verge of garnering an
                            empire, the Whig lord's great house was frequently designed in the
                            Palladian style. The simple dignity of this form of classical
                            architecture and its relatively modest scale evoked more effectively the
                            virtues of the antique world than did the more flamboyant and grandiose
                            architecture of the contemporary Baroque style.</p>
                        <p>An amateur architect and the center of an influential artistic and
                            literary coterie, <name type="pname">Lord Burlington</name> created his
                            villa at <name type="place">Chiswick</name> as a small-scale version of
                                <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s <name type="place">Villa
                                Rotonda</name> (fig. 7.1). The landscape he created there over a
                            twenty-year period beginning in <date when="1725">1725</date> pioneered
                            the marriage of a symmetrical Palladian house with an artfully irregular
                            landscape that nevertheless preserved elements of Continental classical
                            order. Within the garden were winding paths and long perspectival
                            corridors of greenery framing obelisks and several small Palladian
                            temples and pavilions.</p>
                        <p>Other Whig lords were also amateurs in the original sense of the word:
                            lovers of literature and the arts and sciences. They were students of
                            the classics, travelers abroad and connoisseurs of painting, sculpture,
                            and architecture. In addition, they were active on behalf of liberal
                            reform and jealous guardians of recently granted political freedoms
                            (including the freedom to disagree overtly with their government).
                            Owners of large tracts of newly enclosed rural land, they solicited and
                            implemented the advice of their literary mentors. Their patronage of a
                            new generation of designers transformed garden design from an art based
                            on architectural geometry to one based to a large degree on techniques
                            of painterly composition. Their gardens were no longer created with
                            "rule and line," but rather as a painter would compose a subject on a
                            canvas. In them, poetry and history were employed as resources for
                            various thematic itineraries.</p>
                        <p>As we walk today through some of these now-historic English gardens, it
                            is difficult to remember how filled with associative meaning they were
                            to their first visitors. Indeed, even by the middle of the eighteenth
                            century, as we shall see, general acquaintance with old mythologies and
                            their imagery was disappearing and the emblematic character of landscape
                            was being replaced by a less didactic approach to design, one that the
                            garden historian <name type="pname">John Dixon Hunt</name> calls
                            "expressive." This type of garden relied less on such keys to

                            a series of staged scenes where the human visitor was both spectator and
                            actor. But unlike the theater, where pastoral dramas were enacted before
                            the stationary spectator, here the viewer moved from scene to scene, and
                            the scenes themselves were only allusive settings in which the dramatic
                            action existed solely in the mind of each visitor. Indeed, the human
                            mind itself was the protagonist in these green theaters.</p>

                            his <hi rend="italic">Observations, Anecdotes, and Characters of Books
                                and Men</hi>, quotes Pope as saying, "All gardening is
                            landscape-painting. Just like a landscape hung up." Pope maintained this
                            visual approach to poetry as well; his translation of <name type="pname"
                                >Homer</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> shows a keen
                            picturesque sensibility as he organizes several memorable scenes in the
                            manner of <hi rend="italic">tableaux vivants</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Although a Catholic Tory, <name type="pname"
                                >Pope</name> was a friend to the progressive Whigs whose interests
                            he shared. Like other members of <name type="pname">Lord
                                Burlington</name>'s coterie, he admired Palladian architecture and
                            was deeply committed to the classical traditions of ancient <name
                                type="place">Rome</name>. Like Addison, he scorned topiary and
                            faulted symmetry because it produced monotony and lack of variety,
                            well-ordered variety being perhaps the single most esteemed trait in
                            Pope's theory of design.</p>
                        <p>His own garden at Twickenham was famed above all for its remarkable
                            three-chambered grotto, the walls of which were studded with mineral
                            specimens, shells, and mirrors to reflect and multiply the view, a place
                            where Pope could engage in reverie, literary pursuit, or conversation
                            with his constant stream of visitors. This grotto was conceived as a
                            dream chamber, a place both to soothe and stimulate the mind. While this
                            eighteenth-century version of a classical <hi rend="italic"
                                >nymphaeum</hi>, with its artificial stalactites, imbedded minerals,
                            and dripping water, was obviously the height of artifice, Pope was proud
                            to boast that he had "strictly followed Nature" in creating it. And,
                            from his perspective, he was correct. He had eschewed the elaborately
                            artificial hydraulics and arcane mythological decorative programs of
                            Renaissance grottoes in favor of a more naturalistic cave in which he
                            had arranged his geological specimens so as to simulate a quarry or
                            mine. Pope's grotto was, above all, a highly personal expression,
                            containing associations with the many friends whom he had entertained
                            there and reminding him through its numerous geologic specimens of the
                            correspondents who had sent them to him.</p>
                        <p>Another popular and influential poet, <name type="pname">James
                                Thomson</name> (<date when="1700">1700</date>&#x2013;<date
                                when="1748">1748</date>), saw the English garden as a metaphor for
                            British freedoms. He is remembered for<pb n="237"/><pb n="237"
                                type="orig"/>his long poem and life work <hi rend="italic">The
                                Seasons</hi>, a paean to British landscape that anticipates
                            Romanticism in its religious attitude toward nature. His reverential awe
                            for nature's bounty and beauty was coupled with the growing pride the
                            English felt in the loveliness of their countryside, particularly as the
                            wave of landscape improvement swept the nation. For Thomson the realm of
                            imagination and the realm of landscape were intertwined. The mind itself
                            was a kind of landscape: "the varied scene of quick-compounded thought,"
                            in which "visionary vales," "weeping grottoes," and "prophetic glooms"
                            provoked reflection. It was "the mind's creative eye" that gave meaning
                            to sensation.<ref target="#CH7-n9"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"

                        <p>The philosophy that saw the mind as a theater of sensation and therefore
                            landscape experience as a stimulus to reflection caused some landed
                            Englishmen to think about their properties in a new way. Ordinary
                            farmland could be ornamented with monuments that evoked sensations,
                            heightening interest and stimulating emotion. A farm could therefore be
                            both practical and poetic. The notion of the <hi rend="italic">ferme

                            His influential volume <hi rend="italic">The Nobleman, Gentleman, and

                            from two decades of landscape design development. It is against the
                            background of the enclosure movement that Switzer's popularity and that
                            of later garden theorists and practitioners can be best understood.</p>
                        <p>Since the waning of the Middle Ages, as <name type="place"
                            >Britain</name>'s population swelled and sheep and cattle grazing became
                            a dominant agrarian activity, ancient forestland and inhospitable heath
                            had been converted to hedged fields and pastures, notably in the
                            southern counties. Around certain ancient villages, where there were
                            additional grassy downs for grazing, some of the open fields, which had
                            formerly been held as commons and tilled by allotment, were enclosed by
                            contract agreement. This process of enclosure accelerated in the
                            eighteenth century when more than 3 million acres of arable land were
                            enclosed by acts of Parliament and private treaty as the economic value
                            of improved turf for grazing transformed British agriculture from a
                            communitybased system of open-field cultivation and common pasturage to
                            one of private ownership.</p>
                        <p>Simultaneously, in response to <name type="place">England</name>'s timber
                            famine in the seventeenth century, <name type="pname">John
                            Evelyn</name>'s influential book <hi rend="italic">Sylva</hi> had
                            promoted a tree-planting program, and the reforestation of the
                            countryside in order to increase the production of wood for fuel,
                            shipbuilding, and other forms of construction was now fully under way.
                            The enclosed lands, a combination of rectangular fields hedged with
                            white hawthorn interspersed with ash and elm trees, were called parks.
                            Where foxhunting was a sport, there were occasional copses between the
                            fields. The increased control over water supplies by wealthy owners, who
                            were able to impound it in ponds and pump it through pipes, made
                            possible a far greater independence in the siting of houses than
                            heretofore. This permitted a thorough consideration of the presentation
                            of the residential seat and the views to be enjoyed from its windows.
                            The vast amount of estate improvement attendant upon enclosure
                            effectively transformed the English countryside into the landscape we
                            know today. This tremendous beautification effort came at the price of a
                            great deal of human suffering. Enclosure took pasturage rights away and
                            forced the majority of rural people to become tenant farmers.</p>
                        <p>This is the context in which Switzer enthusiastically claimed the <hi
                                rend="italic">ferme orn&#x00E9;e</hi> to be derived from "some of
                            the best Genius's of <name type="place">France</name>," as well as from
                                <name type="place">Rome</name> where it had been proved "the truest
                            and best Way of Gardening in the World, and such as the politest and
                            best Genius of all Antiquity delighted in." These were encouraging words
                            for literary and aesthetically inclined landowners who wanted to
                            incorporate poetic and painterly sensation into their recently enclosed
                            utilitarian landscapes. But Switzer was, after all, a professional man
                            dependent upon the favor of his clients. As many of these still owned
                            the kind of gardens that had been laid out in the French classical
                            tradition, he advanced his ideas more cautiously than did the literary
                            advocates and their friends, the Whig
                            landowners.</p>

                            even greater degree than Switzer the lingering influence of French

                            plots. Geometric basins in the French manner form the centerpieces of
                            these curious mazes, and elsewhere in his "grand, beautiful and natural"
                            gardens he advocates broad, straight avenues and geometrically shaped
                            lawns. Like Switzer's, his is a how-to book. In appealing to a clientele

                            of the eighteenth century and an understanding of the transformation of
                            landscape gardening aesthetics as the century continued. While gardening
                            for the British Augustans was an art in which the emblems of classical
                            literature, friendship, family, and nation were important, in <name
                                type="pname">Whately</name>'s day, the deities and heroes could
                            quietly steal away as the expressive qualities of nature's own
                            materials&#x2014;"ground, wood, water, and rocks"&#x2014;became the sole
                            means of composing landscapes. Though shorn of temples and other
                            symbolic structures, a well-designed landscape could, nonetheless, evoke
                            a range of moods. <name type="pname">Whately</name>'s <hi rend="italic"

                            arts. The naturalistic approach it recommended found a receptive

                            impression. Sublimity lay in those scenes that, because of their awesome
                            size, sharp colors, loud sound, association with the unknown, and often
                            abrupt irregularity, caused sensations best described as a kind of
                            admiring terror or fearful wonder. Beauty, on the other hand excited
                            "the passion of love, or some correspondent affection" and could be
                            found not, as Descartes and <name type="pname">Le N&#x00F4;tre</name>
                            had found it, in mathematical proportion, but rather in such qualities

                            undulating surfaces, and curving lines. For gardeners, this last quality
                            was of the greatest importance, accounting for the almost complete
                            abandonment of straight lines in favor of the continuous S-curve known

                            designers. This was reinforced by a growing belief in the power of ruins
                            to inspire a mood of elegiac melancholy, of dark-toned vegetation to
                            turn the thoughts into paths of somber reflection, of bright green
                            meadows to soothe the agitated soul, of sunny fields reminiscent of
                            harvest revels to raise the spirits to the level of gaiety, of still
                            brooks and placid lakes to speak of peace and serenity, of loud tumbling
                            waterfalls to induce a thrilling fear. Water, in particular, was for
                                <name type="pname">Whately</name> a practically indispensable
                            element in the garden. Indeed, according to him, "So various are the

                    <p>The sober grandeur of Palladianism, the elevated moral tone of classical
                        ornament, the fascination with real and fabricated ruins, the thematic
                        itineraries of allegorical heroism: it was by these symbolic means that many
                        eighteenth-century upper-class Englishmen invested their country estates
                        with the ideal of their nation as a new <name type="place">Rome</name>.
                        These landscapes became through acts of imagination and arrangement
                        emblematic of the Arcadian scenery associated with an ancient Golden Age or,
                        more specifically, with the period when the Roman republic was turning
                        toward imperial greatness. Their owners intended them to evoke the paintings
                        by <name type="pname">Claude</name> and <name type="pname">Poussin</name>
                        that hung in the galleries of their great houses. Thus was national ambition
                        wedded to the serenely smiling, architecturally ornamented native landscape
                        in a vision of nature as blessed, beautiful, and peculiarly English yet also
                        Roman, an idyll with a political subtext.</p>

                            preeminent example of this ideal. Because <name type="pname"
                                >Cobham</name> was an influential and vocal <name type="pname"
                                >Whig</name> politician and hired landscape designers who mirrored
                            his libertarian values in their transformation of Stowe's grounds from a
                            plan of geometricized regularity to one of naturalistic free-flowing
                            lines, it occupies a place of influence in garden history almost
                            comparable to that of <name type="place">Versailles</name>. Stowe was
                            also a cultural mecca, as visits by the poets Pope and Thomson and the
                            dramatist <name type="pname">William Congreve</name> (<date when="1670"
                                >1670</date>&#x2013;<date when="1729">1729</date>) attest. As its

                            quickly realized, Stowe became a favorite stop for eighteenth-century

                            dismissed from government office. Already, like other rusticated Whigs,
                            he had started to channel his energy into revising the old-fashioned
                            terraced garden adjacent to the original seventeenth-century red-brick
                            house of his ancestors into the most admired and progressively modern
                            landscape garden in <name type="place">England</name> as well as the
                            center of <name type="pname">Whig</name> party politics. <name
                                type="pname">Bridgeman</name>'s work there, in association with
                                <name type="pname">Kent</name>, continued until his death in <date
                                when="1738">1738</date>. It shows a masterly and flexible adaptation

                            the site. <name type="pname">Kent</name>, however, proved to be the
                            bolder collaborator in developing the new direction in landscape design,
                            successfully mediating between older and newer gardening styles. As has

                            landscape as he visited Florence, Genoa, and the Palladian villas of the

                                >19</date>. He was familiar as well with Tivoli, Frascati, and
                            Palestrina outside <name type="place">Rome</name> where he saw such
                            famous ruins as the Temple of Vesta, Hadrian's Villa, and Praeneste, as
                            well as the Villa d'Este, Villa Aldobrandini, and other late-sixteenth-
                            and early-seventeenth-century wonders. The villas of <name type="place"
                                >Rome</name> itself, with their works of sculpture, paintings,
                            objects of art, and large hunting parks, provided more stimuli for his
                            impressionable senses. <name type="pname">Kent</name> was also a stage
                            set designer, and as such he recognized and appreciated the theatrical
                            aspects of Italian gardens and their function as places of luxury and
                            sensory delight.</p>
                        <p>In <date when="1733">1733</date>, <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name>
                            retired permanently from active political life. <name type="pname"
                                >Kent</name> was summoned to Stowe to begin its most innovative
                            design phase. This consisted of creating the Elysian Fields in the
                            valley through which had formerly run the road that approached the house
                            from the east. With the road and the village clustered around Stowe
                            Church removed, the valley could be incorporated into the garden as both
                            a demonstration of the new naturalism and a thematic manifestation of
                            political opinion and idealistic patriotism (figs. 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7,
                            7.8).</p>
                        <p>In <date when="1740">1740</date>, young <name type="pname">Lancelot
                                "Capability" Brown</name> found employment at Stowe. <name
                                type="pname">Brown</name>, who soon became head gardener, is thought
                            to have contributed some of his early-blooming talent to the last
                            landscape completed in <name type="pname">Cobham</name>'s lifetime: the
                            Grecian Valley. The sinuous lines of the valley's tree border complement
                            its gently undulating greensward, giving this part of Stowe a
                            particularly Arcadian effect. The seeming simplicity of this design is,
                            in fact, the result of the same extensive excavation and regrading that
                            characterize <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s later landscape
                            compositions. It is in this impression of serenity and breadth that
                                <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s work is distinguished from <name
                                type="pname">Kent</name>'s, a fact that becomes apparent as we

                                >Kent</name>'s finest work and an expression of his genius for
                            compressing a great deal of poetic power into a small compass.</p>

                            thought scenically, not architecturally. Attention to the tonality of

                            light and dark foliage; expressive use of evergreens and other trees as
                            screens and as a means of modulating otherwise vapid stretches of lawn;
                            creation of both expectation and surprise by withholding choice
                            prospects from immediate view; and the use of classical (and antique
                            British) structures to enliven the distant scene; juxtaposition of the

                                >Kent</name>'s techniques as a designer. At <name type="pname"

                            the <date when="1720">1720</date>s. It is likely that <name type="pname"
                                >Kent</name> visited <name type="pname">Rousham</name> while he was

                        <p>Because of its cramped and highly irregular site, everything depended
                            upon enlarging the garden's apparent extent by, in Pope's words,
                            "calling in the country" beyond the ha-ha. The river <name type="pname"
                                >Cherwell</name>, which traverses the property, serves in effect as
                            part of the encompassing ha-ha system, and the bucolic views of the
                            fields lying on its opposite bank were, even in <name type="pname"
                                >Bridgeman</name>'s early plan, essential components of <name
                                type="pname">Rousham</name>'s landscape. To these <name type="pname"
                                >Kent</name> added a sham ruin, built to resemble a single gabled
                            wall with arches, which rose at the top of a ridge about a mile from the
                            river and was known simply as "the Eyecatcher." Near the river, he
                            restyled an old mill, rechristened the Temple of the Mill, in the Gothic
                            manner to add further picturesque interest to the scene. <name
                                type="pname">Bridgeman</name> had already replaced the old terraced
                            garden in front of the house with a large rectangular bowling green. Its
                            raised borders are defined by ranks of trees channeling the view to the
                            gently rolling fields beyond the <name type="pname">Cherwell</name>.

                            facing the river's sharp elbow-bend. Because of the angle cut by the
                            river, the garden is severely pinched at this point, but <name

                            making this "hinge" the site of his Praeneste Terrace, so named because
                            of his familiarity with the ruined arcades built in tiers on the
                            hillside at Palestrina (ancient Praeneste) from which his design,
                            abbreviated to a single arcade, took its inspiration. The visitor is
                            invited to tarry here on an elegant stone settee sheltered within one of
                            the niches of the arcade.</p>
                        <p>West of the Praeneste Terrace, the slope cradles a gentle valley. <name
                                type="pname">Bridgeman</name> had remodeled a series of descending
                            fishponds into a chain of ornamental basins. <name type="pname"
                                >Kent</name> reconfigured these when he formed the idyllic Vale of
                                <name type="pname">Venus</name> (fig. 7.4). Beyond the <name
                                type="pname">Venus</name> Vale, in a thickly planted grove of trees,
                            he placed a sinuous rill. This narrow channel forms an elegant wavy line
                            leading the eye from the Octagonal Pond beneath the arched cascade, over
                            which <name type="pname">Venus</name> with her attendant swans and
                            cupids presides, to the Cold Bath, a much smaller octagonal pool
                            reflecting the dappled light of the small glade in which it is set.</p>
                        <p>From a lower path, there are uphill views of the Vale of <name
                                type="pname">Venus</name>, where <name type="pname">Pan</name>
                            emerges from the trees to spy on <name type="pname">Venus</name>. One
                            can also see the Praeneste Terrace and, beyond the sharp bend in the
                            river, <name type="pname">Bacchus</name>, <name type="pname"
                                >Mercury</name>, and <name type="pname">Ceres</name> assembled in a
                            semicircular glade. Although these sculptures evoke the antique world,
                            they do not furnish the garden with as explicit an iconography as that
                            found at Stowe. This may be so because <name type="pname">Kent</name>,
                            by temperament and because he lacked a classical education, hewed to a
                            decorative and scenographic approach to landscape design.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, there were several aristocratic cognoscenti who wanted to
                            infuse their landscape improvements with literary themes as well as
                            painterly perspectives. <name type="pname">Virgil</name>, <name
                                type="pname">Ovid</name>, and <name type="pname">Milton</name> were
                            never far from their minds as they set about this task, nor were the
                            sentiments expressed by their contemporary, Thomson, who wrote the ode
                            "Rule, Britannia." It is not surprising therefore to see in the gardens
                            of these British Augustans patriotic evocations of a new imperial Golden
                            Age. In Alberti, whose <hi rend="italic">De re aedificatoria</hi> was
                            first published in English in <date when="1726">1726</date>, they found
                            a mentor on classical architecture and the amenities of country life.
                            Likewise, they eagerly studied the letters of Pliny the Younger, who had
                            divided his time between affairs of state and the pleasures of fruitful
                            leisure at his country estates. Whether working as their own designers
                            or with professionals to create gardens of heroic allusion&#x2014;which
                            were, in effect, statements of pride in <name type="place"
                                >England</name>'s own embarkation upon the course of
                            empire&#x2014;these garden owners took their place in the long tradition
                            of Renaissance humanism.</p>

                                dissidents. Here the visitor was given an experience to inspire the

                                great Cross Walk, which symbolized the route into the imaginary
                                Elysium, <name type="pname">Kent</name> erected the Temple of

                                respectively poetry, philosophy, military genius, and law. Gazing
                                from the mound upon which it rested, one could see nearby the Temple
                                of Modern Virtue, a sham ruin (now destroyed) bearing a sculpted
                                headless torso, which supposedly represented <name type="pname"
                                    >Robert Walpole</name>. (Understandably, <name type="pname"
                                    >Horace Walpole</name>, his son, later deplored the use of

                                the opposite bank of a small stream named for the river Styx, <name
                                    type="pname">Kent</name> sited the Temple of British Worthies
                                    <hi rend="bold">F</hi>, which featured pedimented niches
                                containing busts of English heroes (see fig. 7.7). Significantly,
                                the still-living <name type="pname">Alexander Pope</name> was
                                afforded a place on the return elevation of the range containing

                                    >Milton</name>, and <name type="pname">Locke</name>. Not without
                                humor, another niche on the back of the temple was sacred to the
                                memory of one Signor Fido, a lamented hunting dog. The bust of
                                Mercury, which adorns the central pyramid, symbolizes the messenger

                                the bridge, the stream widens into the Worthies River. It flows into
                                the Lower River, a serpentine arm of <name type="pname"
                                    >Bridgeman</name>'s Octagon Pond. Here, at the bottom of the

                            the then-radical step of conceiving of architecture in relationship to
                            scenery, allowing the site to dictate the location of the new house
                            parallel to, rather than on axis with, the approach road (fig. 7.10). As
                            at Stowe, the creators of <name type="pname">Castle Howard</name>'s
                            landscape destroyed a village without apparent remorse as the
                            Anglo-Palladian great house with its magnificent cupola, the first of

                            sweeping view to the south.</p>
                        <p>Adjacent to the eastern flank of the house rose a dome-shaped hill known
                            as Wray Wood where between <date when="1718">1718</date> and <date
                                when="1732">1732</date>, possibly with advice from Switzer, <name

                            paths and various fountains set within a naturalistic plantation of
                            trees. Bisecting a stately north-south approach road about 500 yards
                            (457 meters) west of the house, a cross avenue carried one past the
                            entrance court to a terminus at the edge of Wray Wood. At the
                            intersection of these two straight avenues, an obelisk (<date
                                when="1714">1714</date>) commemorates the duke of Marlborough;
                            framing it, farther south, is the massive Pyramid Gate (<date

                            proto-Romantic gothicism, reminds us of the medieval origins of this
                            eighteenth-century country seat as <hi rend="italic">Castle</hi>
                            <name type="pname">Howard</name>. Farther south, at the entrance to the

                        <p>As at Stowe, where modified tradition leapt to pure innovation, here,
                            too, a choice was made to abandon rectilinear design in favor of scenic
                            composition. <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> turned the old lane
                            below Wray Wood, which had led to the now-destroyed village of <name
                                type="pname">Henderskelf</name>, into Terrace Walk, a broad grassy
                            path with a scenic terminus in <name type="pname">Vanbrugh</name>'s
                            Temple of the Four Winds (fig. 7.12). This structure was modeled upon
                                <name type="pname">Palladio</name>'s Villa Rotonda. To the east of
                            the Temple of the Four Winds, <name type="pname">Hawksmoor</name>'s
                            majestic Mausoleum, a domed rotunda with a Doric colonnade set upon a

                            to the landscape. In the middle distance, between the Temple of the Four
                            Winds and the Mausoleum, a Palladian bridge of about <date when="1744"
                                >1744</date> spans the serpentine river whose bed had been excavated
                            through the fields, giving additional classical character to the
                            picturesque scene.</p>

                            interpreted as a series of stations evoking Aeneas's journey from Troy
                            to his founding of <name type="place">Rome</name>, an odyssey that might
                            have symbolized for <name type="pname">Henry Hoare II</name> his

                            clearly meant the landscape of Stourhead to be a dreamworld inhabited by

                            the head of the lake, the Temple of Flora (<date when="1744"
                            >1744</date>; originally Ceres) bears over its portal the injunction of

                            the lake had to be built before the dam could impound the waters at the
                            head of the Stour and give them their intended setting. Shelving banks
                            for the future lake had to be built as well, a task that continued until
                            the dam's construction in <date when="1753">1753</date>. At the same

                            was derived from a drawing by <name type="pname">Palladio</name>, earned
                            the circuit path around to the grotto over the northern arm of the

                            refuge with his men, the path leads toward a visionary scene that bears
                            an obvious relationship to <hi rend="italic">Coast View of Delos with

                            (fig. 7.15). This painting depicts Aeneas with his father, his son, and
                            Anius the priest standing on a terrace in front of a Doric temple,
                            gazing at a landscape containing a round temple modeled on <name
                                type="pname">Hadrian</name>'s Pantheon in <name type="place"
                                >Rome</name>. In the Virgilian text upon which the painting is
                            based, a travel-weary Aeneas has been praying to Apollo to grant him and
                            his descendants a home by allowing him to fulfill his destiny by
                            founding <name type="place">Rome</name>. <name type="pname"
                            >Hoare</name>'s Pantheon, built according to Flitcroft's design as a
                            miniaturized version of the Roman one, is the visual and symbolical
                            focus of the Stourhead landscape (fig. 7.16).</p>
                        <p>Across the lake, on axis with the Pantheon, <name type="pname"
                                >Hoare</name> built a stone bridge patterned after a design by <name
                                type="pname">Palladio</name>. In the opposite direction, toward the
                            village, was a view of the Bristol High Cross, which marked the
                            principal intersection of that city before it was declared an
                            obstruction and dismantled. In <date when="1764">1764</date>, <name
                                type="pname">Hoare</name> acquired its disassembled pieces from an

                            trophy blends with the mellow medievalism of the village and reinforces
                            the garden's iconographic alliance between the glories of<pb n="247"

                                <date when="1780">1780</date>, broadened the garden's palette of
                            plant material as an increasing number of exotic species began to be
                            naturalized in <name type="place">England</name>. He was an avid
                            plantsman and a member of the Linnean Society, who planted many of the
                            mature ornamental trees and some of the huge old rhododendrons one sees
                            today. Like his forebears, he lived for a considerable time in <name
                                type="place">Italy</name> where his talents as a draftsman and
                            watercolorist flourished and his purchases increased the number of fine
                            paintings in the house. An antiquarian and therefore something of an
                            architectural purist, he removed Stourhead's Turkish Tent, Venetian
                            Seat, and Chinese Alcove, garden features his grandfather had added when
                            such Rococo eclecticism was fashionable. At the same time, in <date
                                when="1806">1806</date>, he gave the small cottage between the
                            grotto and the Pantheon a Picturesque Gothic porch.</p>
                        <p>In removing elements he considered extraneous and developing the garden
                            at Stourhead no longer as a contrived sequence of emblematic
                            associations but rather as an overall scenic idyll, Colt <name
                                type="pname">Hoare</name> followed the taste of his time. The
                            perception of the world in terms of Lockean sensibility was gradually
                            giving way to the less intellectual set of values that formed the
                            seedbed of Romanticism. His broad simplification of his grandfather's
                            original plan and the use of natural materials as the principal
                            expressive force in landscape design paralleled the work at Stowe that
                            was being carried out by <name type="pname">Richard Grenville</name>,
                                <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name>'s nephew and heir.</p>
                        <p>Stowe, with Grenville's simplifications and noble additions, such as the
                            Grecian Temple, modeled on the Maison Carr&#x00E9;e, the Roman temple at
                            N&#x00EE;mes, long remained the epitome of English Augustan garden
                            style, an international cynosure visited by the <name type="pname"
                                >Empress Catherine</name> the Great, <name type="pname">Jean-Jacques
                                Rousseau</name>, <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>, and
                            many others. But already the allusive garden of humanistic and heroic
                            messages was a thing of the past, and although its style and features
                            would be imitated on the Continent in years to come, in <name
                                type="place">England</name> its function as a model was over.</p>
                        <p>In the last third of the eighteenth century, when parliamentary acts of
                            enclosure were creating a vast number of new estates, prosperous British
                            landowners were less interested in making neoclassical Arcadias than in
                            achieving a series of pleasing views as they toured their acres or gazed
                            at them from their country houses.<ref target="#CH7-n18"><hi rend="sup"

                            fell into the hands of the untraveled, relatively uneducated, yet

                    <p>British mercantile policies in the middle of the eighteenth century regulated
                        a vigorous commerce that worked in the country's favor, with trade doubling
                        between <date when="1750">1750</date> and <date when="1800">1800</date>.
                        After <date when="1780">1780</date>, the Industrial Revolution accelerated
                        dramatically. This process was assisted both by the invention of new
                        production machinery and by the availability of an industrial labor force
                        following enclosure when many tenant farmers were uprooted from the land.
                        While <name type="place">England</name> felt the nascent surge of industrial
                        capitalism, and its cities were beginning to increase significantly in
                        population, it was still a preindustrial country. Its wealth was based upon
                        a greatly expanded domestic and international trade, together with a more
                        productive animal husbandry and agriculture than had heretofore been
                        practiced. This wealth provided the substance with which to carry out the
                        transformation of the eighteenth-century English countryside. By most
                        accounts, the country was fortunate in having at hand a talented individual
                        who felt himself capable of reshaping many estates so that they expressed
                        the new agrarian prosperity in terms of an entirely "English" ideal.</p>

                            enterprise. Between the time he left his position as head gardener at

                            piece with this larger landscape; a garden was simply a rural working
                            landscape arranged so as to be at once productive and beautiful.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s style, stripped of association, was in
                            its own way as abstractly classical as that of <name type="pname">Le
                                N&#x00F4;tre</name>, and the volume of earth movement and
                            topographical regrading required to achieve his seemingly naturalistic
                            results was no less monumental than that required by the French master.
                                <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s eye was selective; it edited out
                            the blemishes of nature, smoothing away abrupt contours and camouflaging
                            its "accidents" with screening foliage. He was often referred to as a
                            "landscape improver,"<ref target="#CH7-n19"><hi rend="sup"><hi
                                        rend="bold">19</hi></hi></ref> and with the unconscious
                            presumption of a deity he set about <hi rend="italic">correcting</hi>
                            nature to conform with an aesthetic ideal, which the poet Thomson hailed
                            as "purest truth." Although <name type="pname">Brown</name> left no
                            written theory, he undoubtedly believed that through rational science
                            landscape could be perfected to a state wherein human beings and nature
                            could meet on equal terms, in fruitful partnership.</p>
                        <p>From a technical point of view, other things were necessary as well, and
                            in this regard <name type="pname">Brown</name> came to his profession
                            far better prepared than <name type="pname">Kent</name>. Although <name
                                type="pname">Brown</name> spent his youth in the small <name
                                type="place">Northumberland</name> village of Kirkharle where he was
                            born, he was able to observe the estate improvement occurring in the
                            immediate vicinity. His walk to school in Cambo took him past Wallington
                            Park, which, after enclosure, was enjoying various improving alterations
                            to its previously barren and degraded landscape. These included the kind
                            of large-scale reforestation and hedgerow planting ubiquitous in <name
                                type="place">England</name> at the time. In <date when="1732"
                                >1732</date>, after leaving school, he became a gardener at
                            Kirkharle Hall where <name type="pname">Sir William Loraine</name> was
                            creating a similar working landscape. Here <name type="pname"
                                >Brown</name> learned to drain swamps and acquired a practical
                            knowledge of horticulture. It was with these skills that he left home,
                            in <date when="1739">1739</date>, for <name type="place"
                                >Oxfordshire</name> in the south, finding employment first at
                            Kiddington Hall and then, two years later, at Stowe.</p>
                        <p>It was <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s lucky exposure to <name
                                type="pname">Kent</name>'s recent work in the Elysian Fields at
                            Stowe that broadened his aesthetic horizons, while his employment by
                                <name type="pname">Lord Cobham</name> allowed him to expand his
                            professional abilities. Surveying, hydraulic engineering, and
                            architecture were skills he readily acquired. He became sufficiently
                            competent as a draftsman to develop plans for various neighboring
                            estates, whose owners soon sought his services. Site planning came
                            easily to him, and he quickly found himself not only recommending the
                            placement of various manor houses but designing them as well. Within the
                            bounds of a conventional Palladianism, he provided his clients with
                            mansions and garden buildings that were remarkable for their sound
                            construction, comfort, and convenience.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Brown</name> was probably familiar with the aesthetics

                            the sinuous, rather than the straight, line. The first of several
                            editions of <name type="pname">Edmund Burke</name>'s treatise <hi

                                >1757</date>. In it <name type="pname">Burke</name> set forth his
                            concept of beauty as a "feminine" ideal composed of smoothness and
                            softly rounded contours. He elaborated this definition in sensuous
                            terms, likening beauty to the charm "of being swiftly drawn in an easy
                            coach on a smooth turf, with gradual ascents and declivities,"<ref

                            experience.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not <name type="pname">Brown</name> was a student of <name
                                type="pname">Burke</name> and Hogarth in a conscious sense, their
                            ideas were part of a Rococo aesthetic found in mid-eighteenth-century
                            Georgian design, as characterized by the flowing lines and naturalistic
                            forms of <name type="pname">Thomas Chippendale</name>'s furniture. It is
                            not surprising, therefore, that <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s style
                            was based upon an undulating linearity of ground plane edges, combined
                            with rounded topographic modeling. <name type="place">Southern
                                England</name> naturally offers just such gentle and varied beauty
                            as that recommended by <name type="pname">Burke</name>'s definition,
                            making the improver's art there merely one of emphasis. Thus, by
                            rearranging certain landscape elements, <name type="pname">Brown</name>
                            was readily able to achieve compositions that met <name type="pname"
                                >Burke</name>'s criteria for the beautiful.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Brown</name>, having discarded the emblematic garden,
                            expressed mood through more abstract means than temples, monuments, and
                            inscriptions. "Solemn" groves provided variety and contrast to
                            "cheerful" fields. Placid sky-reflecting water was used almost
                            invariably to bring an air of tranquil repose to the scene. Although he
                            was described as working with "the Poet's feeling" and "the Painter's
                            eye," <name type="pname">Brown</name> attempted neither to evoke Virgil
                            nor render a three-dimensional painting by <name type="pname"
                                >Claude</name>. By contrast, the very Englishness of his landscapes
                            inspired poetry and themselves became the subjects of paintings by such
                            British artists as <name type="pname">John Constable</name> (<date
                                when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>) and

                                when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>).</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s work displays a strong plastic
                            sensibility. He achieved the smoothness that <name type="pname"
                                >Burke</name> prized by extensive regrading and by removing all
                            rough obsta<pb n="249"/><pb n="249" type="orig"/>cles and "accidental"
                            defects from the terrain. The resulting topography is never flat nor
                            monotonously sloping in one direction, but shaped to form a series of
                            gentle convex and concave curves. Where a slope meets a level plane of
                            lawn or water, <name type="pname">Brown</name> created a soft tangential
                            curve called a "concave scoop," and many of his finest views appear as
                            long dells with higher ground softly swelling on either side (fig.
                            7.17). Trees are never planted in ranks, but rather in clumps, belts,
                            and screens that partially reveal more distant prospects. He used both
                            deciduous and evergreen native species for the most part, following
                                <name type="pname">Kent</name>'s practice of contrasting light and
                            dark foliage in order to realize effects of perspective. The curving
                            lines of his drives, tree belts, and lake edges never run along parallel
                            courses, but in harmonious naturalistic configurations.</p>
                        <p>His ha-has, placed at right angles to the line of vision, ensure that
                            these sunk fences are imperceptible to the eye traveling to the fields
                            beyond, and their sides slope gradually so as to permit cattle to browse
                            at their edges, thereby eliminating obtrusive tufts of spiky vegetation.
                            Deer still graze in several of his parks, cropping the grass, and by
                            clearing the lower branches of the trees up to a uniform line, they make
                            possible long views through the woods.</p>
                        <p>A necessary component of <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s landscapes was
                            an element of suspense. The same kind of hideand-reveal tactics that we
                            will discern when we examine Japanese gardens can also be recognized in
                            his. The belts of trees, designed to screen his circuit drives, some
                            working fields, and other "eyesores" were planned with gaps to expose
                            those aspects of the agricultural landscape that harmonized with his
                            designs. His walks and drives were designed to entice carriage rides and
                            perambulation, and his broad lakes invited visual exploration, but he
                            never allowed eye and body to traverse the same route. Straight lines do
                            not exist in <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s compositions, and it is
                            only by means of a leisurely circuitous amble that one gains the object
                            in view. As at Stourhead, his parks are meant to be traveled on foot or,
                            more likely, considering their scale, by carriage, but unlike <name
                                type="pname">Hoare</name>'s lakeside route at Stourhead with its
                            Virgilian features, <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s tours are not
                            thematic; they attempt merely to stir human emotions rather than the
                            intellect.</p>
                        <p>Capability <name type="pname">Brown</name> demonstrated his greatest
                            skill in his thorough knowledge of drainage techniques and handling of
                            water (fig. 7.18). The gentle transition between ground plane and water
                            surface ensured an effect of maximum reflectivity, as one does not look
                            down into his water from above, but rather across it. By making the
                            contours of his lakes irregular and obscuring their curving ends in the
                            shadows of dense plantings, or screening them with foreground islands,
                            he was able to add an air of mystery to his scenery. <name type="pname"
                                >Brown</name> also was a master builder of naturalistic cascades,
                            and these provided additional variety and something approaching Romantic
                            excitement within his otherwise tranquil compositions.</p>

                            extensive human labor was still necessary to maintain his landscapes,

                            essential to sustain the beauty of his flowing lawns.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Brown</name>'s landscapes were ones in which the
                            marriage between house and surroundings was all-important. It was
                            necessary that the view from the house be a controlled one, extending
                            all the way to the horizon. If this was not possible, anything
                            extraneous was excluded from sight by screens of trees. The siting of
                            the house to best advantage and its status as the<pb n="250"/><pb

                            subcontract work, perform on time and within budget, and obtain critical

                            master stroke was to dam the Glyme, thereby flooding the lower piers of

                            The upper parts of the bridge's arches, which remain above the level of

                            geometries, and the bridge itself is perfectly proportioned to the lake
                            (fig. 7.20). Upon entering <name type="pname">Blenheim</name> Park from
                            the village of Woodstock, the visitor sees this dreamlike vision: the

                            Palladian bridge, a Chinese temple, a ten-story pagoda, and a Roman
                            triumphal arch in ruins (fig. 7.21). Of this array, only the last two

                        by swift currents of history even as these debates occurred, soon made the
                        practice of landscape design a public responsibility rather than a private
                        entertainment, and the arguments over the respective merits of the

                        sometimes echo for years after their participants are gone.</p>
                    <p>The Picturesque controversy was taken up by the periodicals of the day, after
                        which it became table talk in country houses throughout the land. This was
                        so because people had begun to regard sight-seeing as a delightful form of
                        recreation. Carriage travel had<pb n="252"/><pb n="252" type="orig"/>become
                        relatively convenient and safe, but revolution in <name type="place"
                            >France</name> and other political disturbances made tourist excursions
                        on the Continent difficult. Many people were therefore eager to have their
                        eyes opened to the charms of native scenery. Instructing them in this regard
                        and instilling in them a new concept of regionalism and a new approach to
                        the aesthetics of the natural landscape were the works of <name type="pname"

                            up in the north of <name type="place">England</name> beside the Scottish
                            border, was an early admirer of wilder and more rugged landscapes than
                            those of southern <name type="place">England</name>. Tutored by his
                            father in painting and sketching, he instinctively viewed landscape as
                            artistic subject matter wherein craggy topography and a certain
                            roughness of objects provided greater variety and visual interest than
                            smooth and flowing perfection. His discriminating eye led him to an
                            appreciation of the different varieties of natural scenery as one
                            traveled from one section of <name type="place">England</name> to
                            another. As developed by <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>, the term <hi
                                rend="italic">Picturesque</hi> did not apply to gardens, which "want
                            the bold roughness of nature," and were therefore uninteresting subjects
                            for painters. For him, <hi rend="italic">Picturesque</hi> meant scenery
                            that because of its boldly projecting outcrops of rock, contrasts of
                            dark and light, compositional grouping of trees, and other such
                            attributes was either naturally suitable for picture making or, with
                            some compositional correction to foreground, background, or middle
                            ground, could be made so. His appreciation of scenery was as a
                            two-dimensional framed view of a three-dimensional scene, and his visual
                            satisfaction depended on a correspondence between the works of nature
                            and the animated "roughness" of elements and the atmospheric light and
                            shade that give pleasure in a painting. <name type="pname"
                            >Gilpin</name>'s imagination, therefore, was not excited by wild nature
                            as such, but rather by nature as seen through the filter of art.</p>
                        <p>His own talent as a sketchbook artist admirably served his purposes as a
                            travel writer and illustrator of a new and popular way of looking at

                            analyzed the famous landscape as if it were a painting. Stowe's

                            woods, and other scenes of rough natural beauty abounded. He held that

                        <p>The growing appreciation of wild scenery, as well as the currency that
                            the word <hi rend="italic">picturesque</hi> gained and continued to

                            >Gilpin</name>'s influence. Yet, his career as an artist-tourist was, in
                            fact, written in the margins of his life as a busy schoolmaster and
                            vicar attending his needy rural parishioners.</p>
                        <p>Like Pope, who had employed his summers in traveling for scenic
                            enjoyment, <name type="pname">Gilpin</name> toured the countryside
                            during his vacations as headmaster of Cheam School. He revisited those
                            wild landscapes that had thrilled him as a youth, and he happily spent
                            his days sketching and his evenings writing up his "observations," which
                            were based on an analysis, according to his developing theories of
                            Picturesque beauty, of the scenery he had drawn. He circulated these
                            observations along with sketches from his travels in Wales, the Lake
                            District, and elsewhere in northern <name type="place">England</name> to
                            a growing band of admirers.</p>
                        <p>In <date when="1776">1776</date>, he left Cheam School to become the
                            vicar of Boldre, a parish in Hampshire on the border of the New Forest
                            beside the southern coast of <name type="place">England</name>. There he
                            deepened his appreciation of forest scenery and accumulated sketches and
                            remarks on the diverse qualities of picturesqueness to be found in
                            various species of trees (fig. 7.22). <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>
                            realized at this time that he would be able to derive income beyond that
                            of his clerical living from the publication of the observations and
                            sketches made on his tours. <name type="pname">Horace Walpole</name>
                            helped him find a way to mitigate the financial risk of publishing a
                            book in which several illustrations were a necessity by introducing him
                            to the newly developed aquatint method of printmaking.</p>

                            Following the success of this book, he decided to bring out in two

                            provided sufficient visual interest to serve the painter and that these
                            qualities should be prized by the landscape improver as well. Polished
                            surfaces and carefully articulated masonry joints were tributes to good
                            craftsmanship, but these were hardly as Picturesque as a rubbly ruin,
                            stained by weather, encrusted with moss and sprouting wildflowers.</p>
                        <p>According to <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>, nature was an admirable
                            colorist but deficient in terms of Picturesque composition, and the

                            almost sentimental affection for the few remaining seventeenth-century
                            gardens of Wise and <name type="place">London</name> with their "kings
                            of yew, and goddesses of lead," for by his time these had the virtue of
                            having grown picturesquely decrepit with age. An old-fashioned garden of
                            this kind, in addition, encompassed merely the immediate environs of the
                            house where "Inclos'd by walls, and terraces, and mounds / Its mischiefs
                            were confin'd to narrow bounds." In the same way that the
                            eighteenth-century painter or sketch artist avoided a linear style and
                            crisp outline in favor of chiaroscuro effects of light and shade, so
                            according to proponents of the Picturesque, the landscape improver
                            should avoid neat definitions of forms in favor of hazier, less distinct
                            shapes that produced a more "artistic" appearance. <name type="pname"

                        <p>According to <name type="pname">Price</name>, in studying painting one
                            readily observes that two interrelated qualities constitute the essence
                            of the Picturesque: <hi rend="italic">intricacy</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">variety</hi>. He defines intricacy as "that
                            disposition of objects, which, by a partial and uncertain concealment,
                            excites and nourishes curiosity," while variety in scenery is defined as
                            that which is in opposition to the formulaic perfection of <name
                                type="pname">Brown</name>. Monotony is the enemy of the Picturesque,
                            and <name type="pname">Price</name> deplores that once the "mechanical
                            and commonplace operation, by which <name type="pname">Mr. Brown</name>
                            and his followers have gained so much credit," is begun, one is forced
                            to bid "adieu to all that the painter admires&#x2014;to all
                            intricacies&#x2014;to all the beautiful varieties of form, tint, and

                            can mature, so as to make [the landscape] become the admiration and

                            picturesqueness resides within the eye of the beholder who, by "having

                            invests natural objects with "ideal and imaginary beauties; that is,
                            beauties, which are not felt by the organic sense of vision; but by the

                            <name type="pname">Price</name>, on the other hand, tries to objectify
                            the Picturesque, making it a separate category alongside <name
                                type="pname">Burke</name>'s categories of the beautiful and the
                            sublime.</p>
                        <p>While critical of the serpentine outlines of <name type="pname"
                                >Brown</name>'s bodies of water, <name type="pname">Price</name>
                            reserves his greatest scorn for the improver's method of planting trees
                            in clumps. <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s clumps appear to him
                            variously as regimental soldiers on parade or as so many puddings turned
                            out of a mold. He finds even the old arrow-straight approach avenues of
                            an earlier generation preferable to the narrow winding belts of newly
                            planted trees beside <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s drives. In this
                            vein of contrariety, he romantically admires such entrance roads as
                            those leading to Stowe and <name type="pname">Castle Howard</name> for
                            their solemnity and grandeur, especially at night when a few gleams of
                            moonlight pierce the deep gloom of their dense foliage.</p>
                        <p>Practical minds took with a grain of salt <name type="pname"
                            >Price</name>'s prescription of negligence as a means toward art. Even
                            his admiring mid-nineteenth-century editor inserted into <name
                                type="pname">Price</name>'s reprinted text a note of warning
                            regarding the advantages of smooth, well-graded carriage roads over
                            picturesquely rough ones. While the Picturesque theorists greatly
                            stimulated a new appetite for travel into the wilder parts of the
                            British Isles, estate improvement, with some increased picturesqueness
                            in the park, continued to develop in a manner derived from <name

                            an intermediate position between two perceived polarities prevailed as
                            the English countryside continued to be coaxed into new patterns of
                            domestic felicity was due in large measure to the practice and writings

                            principles of painting and landscaping were not, in fact, one and the
                            same as the Picturesque theorists maintained. According to <name
                                type="pname">Repton</name>, the landscape subject matter suitable
                            for painting was that which could be contained within the
                            representational confines of the artist's canvas, whereas the beauties
                            of real landscape encompassed those of prospect&#x2014;panoramic views
                            obtained from a lofty ridge or belvedere. He maintained that "the good
                            sense and good taste of this country will never be led to despise the
                            comfort of a gravel walk, the delicious fragrance of a shrubbery, the

                            steep hill, because they are all subjects incapable of being

                        <p><name type="pname">Repton</name>, as a professional landscape gardener,
                            had thought it important to discourage amateur improvers who were, in
                            his opinion, in the same position as a patient "quacking himself."
                            Unlike <name type="pname">Brown</name>, whose schooling was essentially
                            vocational, <name type="pname">Repton</name> had, in fact, received a

                            his own enthusiasm as an amateur improver and the realization that, with
                                <name type="pname">Brown</name>'s death, a vacuum had been created,
                            which a man with small means and a growing family could hope to

                        <p>Like his American successor, <name type="pname">Frederick Law

                                <name type="pname">Repton</name> decided to adopt a new vocation in
                                <date when="1788">1788</date>. Having moved into a cottage on Hare
                            Street in the Essex village of Romford in order to accommodate his
                            reduced financial circumstances, <name type="pname">Repton</name>, after
                            a restless night pondering his future, arose, christened himself a
                            "landscape gardener," and had cards printed, which, with the help of his
                            friends, soon brought this new professional nomenclature into currency
                            in the best drawing rooms of <name type="place">England</name>. In order
                            to fulfill his intention of becoming the successor to <name type="pname"
                                >Brown</name>, who had died five years earlier, he set out to see
                            many recently improved estates, including such famous ones as <name
                                type="pname">Blenheim</name> Stowe and, following the new fashion
                            for Picturesque travel initiated by <name type="pname">Gilpin</name>, he
                            made a sketching tour in <date when="1789">1789</date> of the Essex
                            forests.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Repton</name>'s almost immediate success was due to an
                            idea he hit upon at the outset. A talented watercolorist, he would do
                            more than assure his clients of their properties' capabilities; he would
                            demonstrate with his facile pen and brush a series of "before and after"
                            effects. In his Red Books, so named for their red morocco leather
                            bindings, he made watercolor renderings with fold-over flaps. The scene

                            improvement (figs. 7.24a, 7.24b). The volumes became proud tokens of

                            the system devised by the famous improver. Indeed, he advocated no

                            landscape. Participating in the explosion of interest in botany
                            occurring in his day, he incorporated exotic shrubs and trees in his
                            plans and even allowed the flower garden, which had been categorically
                            banished by <name type="pname">Brown</name> and despised by the
                            advocates of the wild Picturesque, to exist once more in the vicinity of
                            the house (fig. 7.25). He grasped the benefits to horticulture as well
                            as the decorative possibilities inherent in industrial technology and
                            found many uses for a new material, cast iron, both as ornament and as
                                <hi rend="italic">treillage</hi>. His pergolas and trellis arches,
                            of both cast iron and wood, diminished the classicism of the landscape
                            and soon became mainstays of the Victorian garden. The
                            cast-iron-and-glass conservatories for tender plants he introduced as
                            gardenlike extensions of the house had a similar result.</p>

                            landscapes are the domain of cultural geographers today and were, as we
                            shall read in Chapter Eleven, also appreciated by the Edwardian garden
                            designer <name type="pname">Gertrude Jekyll</name> (<date when="1843"

                            photographed the cottages, gardens, and farmsteads of rural Surrey at
                            the time when these components of the rural English scene were rapidly
                            disappearing. If we were to chart the general attitude toward the
                            vernacular environment among people of social influence, we might say
                            that <name type="pname">Repton</name> points the way toward a more

                            important as an early example of this <hi rend="italic">rus in urbe</hi>
                            approach to planning. Here, promenades were created as bands of
                            greenery, and housing blocks were built around landscaped squares and on
                            terraces with broad views of open countryside (fig. 7.27). These urban
                            design amenities made Bath a new kind of city, one that married genteel
                            architecture with natural scenery. Immediately popular, the town became
                            in the eighteenth century a favorite locale for members of the
                            aristocracy and gentry seeking to improve their health. It was moreover

                                <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>'s Puritanical Parliament. Before

                            estate into a checkerboard of housing blocks built around a square,
                            Fordyce held a design competition from which emerged Nash's concept of a
                            ring of independent villas within the park and a crescent of town houses
                            at its southern end (fig. 7.28). The plan for Marylebone, which was at
                            that time renamed Regent's Park for Nash's patron, the <name

                            architecture to Reptonian principles of landscape design. After some
                            financial and practical difficulties were overcome, a crescent of
                            stuccoed houses with uniform facades was built along the outer perimeter
                            of the southern part of the park. Only eight of Nash's originally
                            planned fifty-six independent villas were built, nor was the interior
                            ring of row houses realized, and the park gradually began to accommodate
                            other uses.<ref target="#CH7-n36"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="bold"

                            proposed villas, Regent's Park provided an influential example for
                            future suburban-style development in <name type="place">London</name>
                            and elsewhere, and many later speculations in real estate bore the word

                        <p>While most squares in <name type="place">London</name>, unlike those in

                            greenery, they could hardly be called Picturesque. But such was the
                            popularity of this style that, by the early nineteenth century, sheep
                            were allowed to strike a pastoral note in Cavendish Square, and
                            Grosvenor and Portman Squares were given more naturalistic treatment.
                                <name type="pname">Repton</name> himself was commissioned to
                            redesign Cadogan and Russell Squares in a Picturesque manner. With these

                                >London</name> gave the newer parts of its urban fabric a looser
                            weave. The greenery thus inserted into the metropolis remains one of the
                            most appreciated contributions of this era to urban planning.</p>

                            by the <name type="pname">Prince Regent</name> to prepare plans for a
                            new Brighton Pavilion, the <name type="pname">Prince Regent</name>'s

                            conditions. He was able to conceive landscape as a continuum of broad

                            marshes and creating lakes and waterfalls and building ornamental
                            pavilions. Although confessing to "qualms of conscience that half a

                            nevertheless advocated such tree removal in the interest of opening
                            views and "making so many others visible which had previously been quite

                            of park scenery that Olmsted and Vaux strove to achieve (fig. 7.30; see

                                type="place">Britain</name>'s American colonies as an independent
                            republic. In addition, the effects of the Industrial Revolution were
                            beginning to transform both urban and rural life. These cultural
                            currents profoundly altered the enterprise of landscape design, making
                            it only marginally the prerogative of princes and the pastime of the
                            landed gently. The values of a prosperous aristocracy would soon be
                            superseded by the commercialism of a new manufacturing class.</p>

                            portrayal of such a type. The superficial life of fashionable Bath was
                            as alien to <name type="pname">Repton</name>'s temperament as it was to
                                <name type="pname">Jane Austen</name>'s. Like <name type="pname"
                                >William Wordsworth</name> and <name type="pname">Jean-Jacques
                                Rousseau</name>, <name type="pname">Repton</name> recognized that
                            sensibility was the common property of the human soul rather than merely
                            the province of an educated upper class. He was able to embrace the view
                            of nature as a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> good and of landscape design
                            as a <hi rend="italic">social</hi> responsibility. His was a
                            liberal-minded paternalism that was still tied to the old agrarian
                            society, now in transition. <name type="pname">Dorothea Brooke</name> in

                            tenant cottages, would have been a heroine after his heart. Although

                            workhouse for paupers, which he saw as a humane model of that type of
                            institution (fig. 7.31). Perhaps his greatest gift to posterity was the
                            good sense he conferred upon the Picturesque style, modifying it and
                            making it a practicable idiom for the design of the public park, the
                            landscape institution <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of the

                        by, yet philosophically and stylistically separate from, contemporary

                    <p>While Turkish tents and Chinese bridges are also found in eighteenth-century
                        English gardens, these picturesquely Rococo features are more prevalent in
                        French ones. French eighteenth-century gardens were consciously conceived as
                        stage sets by designers who often also worked in the theater. This aspect of
                        French gardens of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&#x00E9;gime</hi> is perhaps
                        also explained by the fact that they spring out of the dramatic tradition of
                        French pastoral romance, which is filled with bucolic sentiment, rather than
                        from a literary tradition of poetry imbued with moral philosophy, as was the
                        case with the English eighteenth-century garden.</p>
                    <p>The structures that ornamented these gardens, called <hi rend="italic"
                            >fabriques</hi>, were like theatrical scenery, usually rustic in style.
                        The enthusiasm for <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi> was such that in the
                        eighteenth-century French gardens that go by the name <hi rend="italic"
                            >jardin anglo-chinois</hi> they became the whole point, more than was
                        the case in <name type="place">England</name> where the balance between
                        ornamental structures and landscape still favored landscape. Some of these
                        gardens were as hill of theatrical set pieces as <name type="place"
                            >Disneyland</name>.</p>
                    <p>While this type of garden was built for the amusement of aristocrats in the
                        years immediately preceding the French Revolution, there were other gardens,
                        also of a Picturesque character, in which <hi rend="italic">fabriques</hi>
                        did not overwhelm nature, where solitary contemplation and quiet friendship
                        were the goal. These were directly influenced by <name type="pname"
                            >Jean-Jacques Rousseau</name> (<date when="1712"
                            >1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778">1778</date>), a principal
                        progenitor of the Romantic movement, whose writings awakened faculties of
                        perception and an intuitive mode of thought in which sentiment, more than
                        reason, was the governing principle. The French Picturesque garden can thus
                        be characterized as falling into two basic types: those of a theatrical,
                        exotic, and libertine <hi rend="italic">anglo-chinois</hi> character on the
                        one hand, and those of a moral and sentimental Rousseauesque character on
                        the other. The former is epitomized by the Parc Monceau, <name type="pname"
                            >Carmontelle</name>'s bizarre fantasy creation for the duc de Chartres,
                        a tame remnant of which survives today as a pleasant green oasis in the

                            effects. The production of sensations&#x2014;particularly those of

                            playwright, set designer, and master of ceremonies for the duke, stated
                            that he wished to create a garden "based on fantasy, &#x2026; the
                            extraordinary, and the amusing, and not on the desire to imitate
                            Nature." An ancestor of the modern theme park, Parc Monceau was built as
                            an elaborate entertainment facility, a magical place evoking other lands
                            and other periods in history (figs. 7.32a, 7.32b, 7.33).</p>
                        <p>An enclosed Winter Garden introduced the visitor to the marvels of the
                            park. It had <hi rend="italic">trompe l'oeil</hi> trees for walls,
                            crystal lanterns, an illuminated waterfall, a grotto, and an overhead
                            room from which musicians entertained those dining below. Passing
                            outdoors, one wandered through a charming rustic farm, past a cabaret
                            and an ornamental dairy, to the romantically Picturesque Ruins of the
                            Temple of Mars. Beyond these stretched the Island of Rocks set in a
                            winding stream overlooked by a Dutch Mill. There was a Flower Marsh and
                            a garden mount, its base on one side constructed as a cave giving entry
                            to the ice house, and its top crowned by a belvedere (alternatively
                            described as a Turkish "minaret" and a Gothic pavilion). Past the Flower
                            Marsh, one came to the Wood of Tombs, which contained, in addition to
                            its romantically suggestive mock tombs, a pyramid, an urn, and a
                            fountain.</p>
                        <p>Classical motifs predominated in the next sections of the garden with,
                            first, an Italian Vineyard presided over by <name type="pname"
                                >Bacchus</name> and, beyond that, the <hi rend="italic">Bois
                                irr&#x00E9;gulier</hi> with more ruined monuments, a statue of
                            Mercury, a bell tower, and Houdon's Fountain of the Bathers. A ruined
                            gate led from here to the Naumachia, built in imitation of those ancient
                            and Renaissance ponds in which mock naval battles were fought. This oval
                            pool featured an obelisk situated on an island of rock and a ruined
                            Corinthian peristyle at one end (fig. 7.33; see fig. 7.32b).</p>
                        <p>Still the catalogue of tourist sights continued. The rest of the
                            visitor's itinerary included the Military Column, a small botanical
                            garden, the Fountain of the Nymph, a sculpture of <name type="place"
                                >Paris</name>, a Turkish tent, a circular temple of marble, a
                            Chinese bridge, the <hi rend="italic">Bois r&#x00E9;gulier</hi>, a
                            ruined castle that served as another belvedere, a water mill, a rustic
                            cascade spanned by a stone bridge, and an island of sheep, which was
                            next to the pretty little farm where one's itinerary through <name
                                type="pname">Carmontelle</name>'s sequence of scenes came full
                            circle. But here there was still more for the busy eye to behold: a <hi
                                rend="italic">parterre</hi> garden in front of the main pavilion,
                            beside which stood a maypole-carousel, called a <hi rend="italic">jeu de
                                bague</hi>, and two more Turkish tents.</p>
                        <p>These were the fantastic pleasures of Parc Monceau, a place where the
                            display of objects, rather than<pb n="263"/><pb n="263" type="orig"/>the
                            plastic modeling of garden space, constituted the landscape designer's
                            principal objective. In its m&#x00E9;lange of exotic styles it provided
                            a more catholic and international perspective than the gardens of <name
                                type="pname">Brown</name> and <name type="pname">Repton</name>,
                            which were, above all, celebrations of the Englishness of <name
                                type="place">England</name>. Here one sought the genie of the
                            Arabian Nights rather than the genius of the place. Perhaps the
                            principal legacy of this and other so-called <hi rend="italic"
                                >anglo-chinois</hi> gardens was as a catalogue of ornamental
                            features for the eclectic designers of parks and gardens throughout the

                        <p>With the increasing secularization of society, as anticlericalism and the
                            growing desire for a new, more democratic social order eroded the
                            authority of the Church, monumental tombs, particularly those of
                            national heroes, assumed a sentimental significance, replacing for many
                            the shrines of saints. <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>, in
                            particular, was adopted by French republicans as their patron.
                            Ermenonville, the site of his burial in a handsome Roman-style tomb, was
                            a pilgrimage spot visited by thousands until his body was disinterred
                            and reconsecrated at the Panth&#x00E9;on in <date when="1794"
                                >1794</date> (fig. 7.36). After the removal of <name type="pname"
                                >Rousseau</name>'s remains, the vacated tomb continued to act as a
                            memorial. In other European gardens where his memory was also revered,
                            such as the one at W&#x00F6;rlitz, copies of the tomb were placed on
                            poplar-planted islands similar to the original grave site at
                            Ermenonville (fig. 7.37). This much-copied garden feature illustrates
                            the elegiac character of Romanticism and also reminds us of <name

                            This led to Morel's retiring from the project and Giradin's proceeding
                            as his own designer as he conceived of how to turn his 2,100-acre

                            effects to the broad panoramas often found in English gardens, a

                            also honored <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s prejudice against

                            in order to bring into view the daily movements of ordinary men and

                            of a flat field with a gently curving stream winding through it (fig.
                            7.38). The southern perspective was framed by a grotto and cascade, and
                            in the lake stood two islands. The smaller one, ringed with poplars,
                            contained <name type="pname">Rousseau</name>'s tomb (see fig. 7.36).</p>

                            than a <hi rend="italic">jardin anglo-chinois</hi>, this garden, begun
                            in <date when="1774">1774</date>, contained Gothic ruins from the
                            village church, a weed-clad pyramid (which functioned as an ice house),
                            a Temple of Pan, an open-air theater, and various exotic <hi

                            cultivated rare plants in his heated greenhouses (the plants were taken

                            agricultural experiments on his model farm. Monville abandoned his
                            original house on the property, the first actual dwelling in the Chinese

                            >Jefferson</name>'s agenda was fundamentally pastoral; his vision of the
                        unfolding landscape was as an unimaginably rich resource, a bounty for
                        future generations. He promoted agriculture as the basis of the young
                        nation's economy, strongly preferring a land of farmers to one in which
                        manufacturing drew people into cities. Whereas <name type="pname"
                            >Rousseau</name> had romanticized Geneva as an ideal arena of
                        citizenship, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, who had witnessed the woes
                        of crowded industrial society in <name type="place">England</name> and mob
                        behavior in <name type="place">Paris</name>, saw the town as a necessary
                        evil at best. The virtuous <hi rend="italic">nationstate</hi>, rather than
                        the virtuous <hi rend="italic">city</hi>-state, was his ideal, an ideal made
                        possible by historic circumstance, especially after the <name type="place"
                            >Louisiana</name> Purchase of <date when="1803">1803</date> gave the

                        reality the antique myth of a pastoral Golden Age encouraged his dream of a
                        society of "genuine virtue" in which men preserved their freedom by turning
                        the immense and potentially fruitful wilderness into independently owned

                            susceptible to geometrical planning, subdivision, and valorization. In
                            "An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent, and End of Civil
                            Government" (<date when="1690">1690</date>), <name type="pname">John
                                Locke</name> had queried, "What would a man value ten thousand or a

                            of the inland parts of <name type="place">America</name>, where he had

                            by the sale of the product?" But now the American land had both
                            utilitarian economic potential as well as aesthetic importance for those
                            who, like <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, could indulge in an

                            meridian lines, which were periodically inflected to account for polar
                            convergence, and "range" lines running east-west. The committee further
                            prescribed that the townships be subdivided into 1-mile-square
                            (640-acre) parcels. Surveying according to this Land Ordinance began
                            along the <name type="place">Ohio</name> River the following year.</p>

                        <p>After the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase, it was necessary
                            to account for previous French and Spanish land grants and the presence
                            of certain rivers. Nevertheless, the relentless march of the national
                            grid continued westward. The government at this time began to subdivide
                            sale parcels into quarter sections of 160 acres, then into half-quarter
                            sections of 80 acres, and finally, after <date when="1832">1832</date>,

                            brought from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, retains an original

                            with a hemicycle of flowering shrubs. In addition to planting the
                            orchard and a kitchen garden on the southern slope, he laid out a
                            horseshoe-shaped lawn to the west along the flattened top of the hill.
                            Though clearly of a rationalistic, scientific, and utilitarian bent, his
                            mind was also inclined toward the Romanticism of <name type="pname"
                                >Rousseau</name>. The melancholy potential of the rural cemetery
                            with monuments and elegiac inscriptions gripped his imagination, and he
                            understood from his reading about English gardens the associative value
                            of temples, grottoes, urns, and texts in stone. Thus, in <date
                                when="1771">1771</date>, he thought about choosing for "a Burying
                            place some unfrequented vale in the park &#x2026; among antient and
                            venerable oaks." He planned to erect in the center of this grove "a
                            small Gothic temple of antique appearance, into which would be admitted
                            very little light, perhaps none at all, save only the feeble ray of an
                            half extinguished lamp."<ref target="#CH7-n50"><hi rend="sup"><hi
                                        rend="bold">50</hi></hi></ref> He also envisioned channeling
                            a stream into a cistern, which might serve as a pool for bathing. At the
                            mouth of the spring he would carve a grotto, to be decorated with
                            translucent pebbles and beautiful shells and in which a sculpture of a
                            sleeping nymph, like the one to be found at <name type="pname">Henry
                                Hoare</name>'s Stourhead, would rest on a couch of moss. Other
                            projects engrossed his imagination, including a cascade and various
                            eye-catchers on Mount Alto across from Monticello. But while it was in
                            his nature to fantasize architecture and daydream about Picturesque
                            garden scenes, these projects inevitably took a back seat to his more
                            pragmatic horticultural interests. No temple ever rose at Monticello, no
                            grotto was built to adorn a spring, and instead of the Romantic burial
                            ground, a simple square graveyard enclosed by a fence was established in

                            woods." However, he liked the way the sight line between the Temple of
                            Friendship and the Temple of <name type="pname">Venus</name> at Stowe
                            passed "not through the garden, but through the country parallel to the

                            while the hill on each side is covered with them, is much deepened to
                            appearance." And at <name type="pname">Blenheim</name> he had to admit
                            that, in spite of his judgment that "this garden has no great beauties,"
                            he was impressed with the cascade and the lake, finding "the water here

                            of landscaping at Monticello. He enlarged the terraced vegetable garden
                            south of the central lawn to a length 1,000 feet (304.8 meters),
                            beautified it with a small garden pavilion, and rearranged its beds so
                            as to make it more agreeable for viewing from above. He laid out a
                            serpentine path within the horseshoe-shaped lawn and created oval beds
                            where he could display the many species of bulbs and flowers that he
                            continually collected. He built a ha-ha to separate the lawn and
                            pleasure grounds from the agricultural landscape. He constructed three
                            circular drives, or roundabouts, each one progressively larger in
                            circumference, for touring the property Between the second and third he

                            the opportunity represented by Poplar Forest even more than his delight
                            in gardening. In his political and social theory, <name type="pname"

                            encompassing contradictory perspectives. His pastoralism and
                            antiurbanism, for instance, were inconsistent with the growth of an
                            independent manufacturing economy in <name type="place">America</name>,
                            which he advanced as a matter of national expedience. When compared with
                            Monticello, Poplar Forest, a project of mathematically derived
                            proportions and geometrical forms, demonstrates that as a landscape
                            designer he was equally capable of pursuing divergent ends. In his

                            the linchpin of his geometrical landscape design (figs. 7.45a,

                        <p>Although <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was familiar with
                            D&#x00E9;zallier, Poplar Forest's landscape was no formulaic application
                            of French garden theory and practice. His interests in mathematics and
                            classical history became increasingly important pastimes in his
                            retirement, for as he confided to <name type="pname">John Adams</name>

                            shapes&#x2014;circles, squares, and squared circles, or
                            octagons&#x2014;are composed within the framework of a 100-foot
                            (30.5-meter) modular system. Its design has cosmological overtones, the
                            mandala-like image of its landscape plan coincidentally echoing forms
                            and alignments found in prehistoric cultures. Its principal entrance
                            faces due north, and its octagonal shape allows for fenestration that is
                            oriented to the Blue Ridge, the Peaks of Otter, and other important
                            local mountains. The entry drive has a circular terminus like that at
                            Mount Vernon, but here its circularity is made emphatic by an outer ring
                            of boxwood trees and an inner concentric ring of five dwarf boxwood
                            hedges, which are divided into four sections by being broken at the

                        <p>Poplar Forest's most unusual design feature, two circular 12-foot-
                            (3.7-meter-) high mounds placed 100 feet equidistant from the east and
                            west fronts of the house, had four willows planted on their tops. These
                            formed a 20-foot (6.1-meter) square&#x2014;the same dimension and shape
                            as the central room of the octagon. More willows encircled the mounds at
                            their midpoint, and at their bases, which are 100 feet (30.5 meters) in
                            diameter, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> planted an outer ring of
                            aspens. The entire composition of house, dependencies, and garden was
                            encompassed by a circular ring road 500 feet (152.4 meters) in diameter.
                            This road was lined with paper mulberries, prized by <name type="pname"
                                >Jefferson</name> for the regularity of their form. Thus, in the
                            end, did <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>'s penchant for mathematical
                            relationships and classical geometries prevail over the tendency toward
                            the Picturesque as expressed in his daydream of a dimly lit Gothic
                            temple as his burial chamber on the grounds of Monticello. This affinity
                            for rational form and proportion is apparent not only at Poplar Forest
                            but also in his last great building project, the University of <name

                                >Jefferson</name> in his predilection for a rotunda at the end of
                            the axis framed by the pavilions, and <name type="pname"
                                >Jefferson</name> decided to use as his model the Pantheon in <name
                                type="place">Rome</name> (fig. 7.46). He deftly employed false
                            perspective in placing the pavilions at increasing intervals to
                            counteract the appearance of spatial compression that occurs when one
                            views aligned objects that are equidistant from one another. Further
                            defining the axis and providing a covered walkway for faculty and
                            students in inclement weather, he decided to connect the five pavilions
                            on either side with a colonnade. Although <name type="pname"
                                >Jefferson</name> could not have been familiar with the stoas found
                            in ancient Greek agoras and gymnasiums, in both form and function this
                            pair of colonnades, which are linked with the colonnaded wings of the
                            Rotunda, may be considered a distant cousin to the stoas where Plato,
                            Aristotle, and other peripatetic teachers met their pupils.</p>
                        <p>Behind the academic pavilions were the dormitories. Between each pavilion
                            and dormitory <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> defined a garden space
                            by means of serpentine walls (fig. 7.47). He also established a
                            botanical garden, which was later replaced by Cabell Hall. That one end
                            of the axis was open was an important element of <name type="pname"
                                >Jefferson</name>'s landscape composition at the University of <name
                                type="place">Virginia</name>. He wished to project the view in this
                                direc<pb n="273"/><pb n="273" type="orig"/>tion to the distant
                            mountains. This scenic gesture was, however, subsequently destroyed by a
                            Neoclassical building built by the Beaux-Arts architect <name
                                type="pname">Stanford White</name> (<date when="1853"

                            thereby closing it at both ends.</p>
                        <p>That <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> practiced within the Picturesque
                            design tradition of <name type="place">England</name> and simultaneously

                            shows the breadth of his intellect and the depth of his interest in
                            nature, landscape, and design. His essays at Monticello, Poplar Forest,
                            and the University of <name type="place">Virginia</name> belong to a
                            long aristocratic tradition of garden design. It is significant in this
                            regard that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was a man much at home
                            in the French court, an Enlightenment rationalist whose fundamental
                            design preference was for Neoclassical forms. It is important to
                            remember also that he was a slave owner as well as the author of the
                            Declaration of Independence. In assessing his importance to the
                            landscape of <name type="place">America</name>, we must not forget that
                            he expressed the country's future as a democratic (and commercial)
                            society in his deployment of the nonhierarchical national grid as a
                            means of subdividing the continent and selling its land. Of particular
                            importance to his nineteenth-century successors, including especially
                                <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson Downing</name> and <name
                                type="pname">Frederick Law Olmsted</name>, was his pastoral vision
                            of an agricultural society and a nation vast enough to accom-modate
                            those aspects of the nascent industrial technology as would benefit it
                            but still leave it unscarred, unpolluted, and un-urban. This was his
                            hopeful, and, in retrospect, poignant legacy to the American
                            landscape.</p>

                    <p>At the same time that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was attempting to

                        revolutionary forces that were beginning to unsettle old concepts of order.
                        The ideals of political revolution were inherent in Romanticism's allegiance
                        to the innate worth of the individual. The old order was fading;
                        aristocratic privilege was gradually being supplanted by notions of
                        equality. Increasingly, entitlement would have less to do with hereditary
                        titles than with the concept of life, liberty, and happiness as the
                        birthright of all human beings. Even in countries that were still
                        monarchies, political systems were evolving that would support in a greater
                        degree than heretofore this ideal of individual rights and, with the advent
                        of industrial capitalism, the ability of many individuals besides members of
                        the landholding class to affect the order of society and the condition and
                        appearance of their surroundings. Two towering late eighteenth-century

                        transition. Both sought to understand nature as well as humanity in deeply
                        imaginative ways. Pivotal figures in a turbulent period of world change,
                        they radiated their profound and lasting influence from remote corners of
                        their native lands, <name type="pname">Goethe</name> from the small

                            influence in this area, however, was less as a designer than as a shaper
                            of the cultural matrix within which the associative potential of nature
                            was directed toward sentimental ends and landscape employed as a theater

                            Winckelmann taught his readers to prefer the cool Olympian grandeur and

                            Stowe and Stourhead. Nor was there at W&#x00F6;rlitz the desire to unite
                            the palace visually with its surrounding landscape as <name type="pname"
                                >Brown</name> had done at <name type="pname">Blenheim</name>. Within

                            meters) high and situated on an island within a branch of the lake, was

                            Published simultaneously in German and French, this work attempted to
                            explicate the evolution of landscape design while articulating a
                            specifically German point of view toward it. <name type="pname"
                                >Hirschfeld</name> saw prehistoric antiquity as a time of felicity
                            and oneness with nature. Subsequently, although the ancient Greeks were
                            not garden designers, the manner in which their temples were situated in
                            nature illustrates the harmony that existed between human beings and
                            landscape in antiquity. <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name> valued the
                            virtues of the villa tradition of republican <name type="place"
                                >Rome</name>, with its fruitful husbandry combined with scholarly
                            leisure, and he lamented its degeneration, as illustrated by the
                            excessive grandeur and too lavish use of ornament in the gardens of
                            imperial <name type="place">Rome</name>. Similarly, he held that the
                            aggrandizement of the garden by <name type="pname">Le
                                N&#x00F4;tre</name> and his followers was inimical to the happiness
                            of the individual, for the French gardens, intended primarily as social
                            settings, defeated the need of the individual to disengage from society
                            for self-renewal and self-discovery in nature.</p>
                        <p>The English garden, in <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s opinion,
                            thus offered a positive antidote to the French-style gardens that then
                            prevailed in the Gennan principalities because the English garden was
                            more conducive to reflection and provided a relaxed setting for personal
                            spontaneity and simple, unaffected behavior. He saw the garden as a zone
                            of mediation between art and nature, society and solitude, a

                        <p>Underlying <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s work was another
                            motive, that of nationalism. Whereas in <name type="place"
                                >England</name> the nationalism espoused by Whig liberals found
                            direct <hi rend="italic">political</hi> expression (as well as symbolic
                            expression in the garden), in <name type="place">Germany</name>, which
                            was fragmented into principalities, the forging of national identity was
                            necessarily through <hi rend="italic">culture</hi>. The <hi
                                rend="italic">Volk</hi>, the German people, were sustained by a
                            venerable racial mythology, which was later dramatized in the operas of
                            the nineteenth-century composer <name type="pname">Richard

                            Ninth Symphony (<date when="1824">1824</date>), was infused with joy in
                            nature, and this joy in nature&#x2014;the nature of dark forests and
                            great rivers and green fields&#x2014;could help to form a new national
                            character, one that in <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s view
                            should be tempered with art. Affect&#x2014;feeling and emotion as
                            opposed to cognition and reason&#x2014;was for him the guiding principle
                            in garden design. Taste, a prized eighteenth-century virtue, had a moral
                            dimension. In the same way as the ancient Greeks had both humanized and
                            deified the larger landscape with their significantly sited temples and
                            shrines, the contemporary German garden designer could uplift the spirit
                            through the embellished natural landscape. The viewer could then create
                            his own mental garden of noble associations and lofty ideals.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>'s "Gennan" garden style provided the

                            contemporary reference, would give the landscape "useful, instructive
                            truth," but those dedicated to Peace, Love, or some similar desideratum,
                            or to a particular individual's valor or contribution to humanity, would
                            be even more desirable. The "borrowed scenery" of village church spires
                            and other distant views would remind onlookers of the reciprocal
                            relationship between nature and humanity and of the garden's place in
                            the larger realm of society. Real heroes were to be preferred to
                            mythological ones, and vernacular, rather than classical, inscriptions
                            were recommended. <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name> is the father of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi>, in which monuments commemorating

                            ideal in such public spaces as these. In the interests of accommodating
                            crowds of promenaders and of increasing security, he recommended broad
                            straight paths in some areas rather than winding, irregular ones. He
                            felt that "comfort and security demand that the roads for wagons and

                            as a guide and advice from the prince of Anhalt-Dessau, <name
                                type="pname">Goethe</name> helped <name type="pname">Duke Karl
                                August</name> undertake certain improvements in the valley of the
                            Ilm where they hoped to create a park in the Romantic style, following
                            the one at W&#x00F6;rlitz. He and the duke planned a riverbank grotto,
                            and he oversaw in an ash grove in the most secluded part of the valley
                            the construction of the Luisenkloster, a wooden "hermitage" with a
                            thatched roof and moss-lined walls.</p>
                        <p>But for <name type="pname">Goethe</name>'s capacious and restless
                            intellect, the limitations of the sentimentalist garden and excessive
                            worship at the altar of nature were becoming apparent. The extraordinary
                            popularity of <name type="pname"><hi rend="italic">Werther</hi></name>
                            had become an embarrassment to him; <name type="pname">Werther</name>'s
                            tragic ending, to say nothing of the youthful suicides made fashionable
                            by its apparent advocacy of emotional excess, was now for <name
                                type="pname">Goethe</name> an implicit indictment of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> movement. Indeed, within the
                            novel the seeds of revulsion against excessive Romanticism had already
                            been sown. Nature&#x2014;sublime and infinite nature&#x2014;"which

                            demon, "a monster forever devouring, regurgitating, chewing and

                            philosophical key to life's meaning.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it was <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> itself, the Romanticist's

                                type="pname">Goethe</name> tried and failed to find in botanical
                            science a fundamental unity that would bespeak a purpose analogous to
                            divine purpose, now discredited by <name type="pname">Deism</name>. Yet
                            in the end his search for the <hi rend="italic">Urpflanze</hi>, or

                            unsuccessful as did his efforts to supplant Linnaeus's system with his
                            attempted <hi rend="italic">Harmonia plantarum</hi>. It had become
                            increasingly clear that science and religion could no longer be unified
                            in a single philosophical framework; the human mind would henceforth
                            find meaning in its own lifetime journey, taking such consolation as
                            could be found from the realm of art.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Goethe</name> explored the dilemma of modern humanity
                            in which the comforts of religion diminish as the dogmas of the Church

                            masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, can be read as the clarion
                            call of modernity and as the text that spells the end of the
                            Enlightenment. Pope's confident assertion that after <name type="pname"
                                >Newton</name> "all was light," is countered in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Faust</hi> not by a "devil's advocate," but by the devil himself,
                            that agent of Darkness, Mephistopheles, who mocks Faust's mystical
                            yearning for oneness with nature.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Goethe</name>, while pointing the way to the future,
                            was one of the last exponents of a cosmopolitan humanism in which
                            classical culture could still provide a working vocabulary for artists.
                            Like <name type="pname">Hirschfeld</name>, he sought the <hi
                                rend="italic">Mittelweg</hi>, or middle way, a compromise between
                            classicism and Romanticism, reason and emotion, sense and sensibility.

                                >1809</date>), the garden becomes a metaphor for the tension created
                            by these polarities within the fabric of society and within the marriage
                            contract. The old gardener regrets that the geometrical garden of former
                            days is now unused and no longer appreciated, while the newly created
                            Romantic garden with its moss hut and sweeping views of picturesque
                            village and countryside becomes the locus of tragedy. Excessive
                            sentiment and unheeded wisdom provide <name type="pname">Goethe</name>'s
                            recipe for doom. This tale of unchecked extramarital passion is
                            interwoven with the narrative of the garden-building project, which the
                            aristocratic owners find to be merely a palliative for the boredom of an
                            otherwise idle existence.</p>
                        <p>But the forces of cultural as well as political revolution had been
                            unleashed, and these proved far too powerful to be restrained. The seeds
                            of German nationalism that had been sown by German Romanticism would
                            flower satanically in the evils of the twentieth century. But
                            Romanticism's legacy has another side. One might say that, by
                            questioning the existence of God and looking for higher meaning in
                            nature, the human race had discovered the true measure of the soul or,

                            Written in the wake of the French and American Revolutions, <name
                                type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s poetry is one of affirmation in
                            which egalitarianism is eagerly endorsed, both politically and in terms
                            of the rights of the human mind (<hi rend="italic">all</hi> human minds)
                            to gain access to emotion and experience. For <name type="pname"
                                >Wordsworth</name>, the human heart is the common property of
                            humanity, and the poet's task is to reveal, through imagination and
                            language, images and ideas that will cause people to exercise this
                            emotional birthright.</p>
                        <p>Simplicity, purity of response, and the innocent wonder of childhood are
                            more important to <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> than elegant
                            expression and enlightened discourse. Na&#x00EF;vet&#x00E9; has its own
                            profundity, and <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> is all. Nature unadorned,
                            shorn of ornament and allusion, is capable of inspiring the loftiest
                            thoughts. The rainbow, much cherished by <name type="pname"
                                >Wordsworth</name> as a symbol, stands for our covenant with nature,
                            a covenant in which our own infinitely renewable imaginative resources
                            are assured by nature's own numinous being.</p>
                        <p>He knows that there is pathos in the yearning for unity and wholeness, as
                            the moments in which one experiences a sense of divine totality are
                            elusive and transitory. Yet <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> finds
                            in our wonderment in the face of nature and in the contentment afforded
                            by "spots of time"&#x2014;the renewal of self through stored
                            recollections of sublimity&#x2014;the apparatus of faith. His poem <hi

                        <p>Nature is thus for <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name> a powerful moral
                            force, teacher, and guide. In <name type="pname">Locke</name>'s
                            philosophy, the senses gave rise to ideas; in <name type="pname"
                                >Wordsworth</name>'s Romantic vision, the transaction that occurs
                            between the human mind and nature awakens a spiritual sense, and this
                            engenders feelings of reverence and awe. In "The Ascent of Snowdon,"
                            with which he concludes <hi rend="italic">The Prelude</hi>, <name
                                type="pname">Wordsworth</name> narrates an epiphany:<q><lg>

                                    <l>That is exalted by an underpresence,</l>

                        <p>With this spiritual legacy, it is understandable that Romanticism became
                            a dominant cultural force in the nineteenth century. The paintings of
                            Turner, the music of Wagner, the criticism of Ruskin, the acting of
                            Bernhardt&#x2014;all attest to the vigorous long life of Romanticism, a
                            movement whose echoes still resonate in our own day.</p>
                        <p><name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s work is pivotal. His is a
                            revolutionary voice championing common humanity. He sings the heroes
                            heretofore unsung; common folk, not legendary heroes, populate his
                            poems. "The Old Cumberland Beggar," "The Idle Shepherd Boys," "The
                            Sailor's Mother," and "The Tinker" exist amid the picturesqueness of
                            "The Ruined Cottage," "HartLeap Well," and "The Waterfall and the
                            Eglantine." For <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>, beauty lies not in
                            a some remote Golden Age, but is "a living Presence of the earth." In
                            "Home at Grasmere" ("The Recluse") he queries:<q><lg>
                                    <l>&#x2026; Paradise, and groves</l>

                        <p>For him, the union of mind and universe is a boundless one; it implies
                            individuation and seeks the sublime in the quotidian. Court and city
                            were corrupt institutions in <name type="pname">Wordsworth</name>'s
                            opinion, the breeding grounds of inequality and misery. It is in the
                            haunts of nature that the mind can itself become a kind of paradise, the
                            place where idealized moral beings like <name type="pname"
                                >Rousseau</name>'s citizen of Geneva or <name type="pname"
                                >Jefferson</name>'s yeoman farmer can experience joy and know
                            self-worth. Solitude was for him a condition to be prized, a necessary
                            means of developing the spiritual within oneself.</p>

                            his own gardens displayed his fine color sense and knowledge of botany
                            (fig. 7.50). Rustic summerhouses, rock walls encrusted with moss and
                            covered with vines, and steps with flowers squeezing through the paving
                            stones were to be found in both. In <date when="1806">1806</date>, at

                        <p>Glimpses of two ivy-clad cottages were allowed to intrude upon this

                            the utilitarianism that would increasingly dominate nineteenth-century
                            culture, believing that these signs of productive husbandry were
                            compatible with the poetic mood of his landscape composition. He felt
                            that the landscape designer should respect the "sentiment of the place,"
                            the term he substituted for Pope's "Genius of the Place." Just as he
                            banished the old classical deities of aristocratic humanism from his
                            poetry, so, too, he wanted in the designed landscape no allusions other
                            than those inherent in natural and rural scenery. He wished to raise
                            aesthetics above the dictates of taste to the realm where the mind,
                            informed by culture, could engage actively and imaginatively with
                            landscape in all its aspects, including the vernacular.</p>
                        <p>The revolutionary era that informed <name type="pname"
                            >Wordsworth</name>'s intellect and to which he gave voice had important
                            consequences for landscape design. Henceforth, <name type="pname"
                                >Bacchus</name> and <name type="pname">Pan</name> would absent
                            themselves from the garden. With them, too, would disappear an
                            international vocabulary of landscape ornament as cosmopolitan culture
                            gave way to the ideals of Romantic nationalism. Thus, in an extension of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Volksgarten</hi> concept, folk heroes and other
                            emblems of a political and secular order would take the place of antique
                            divinities.</p>
                        <p>In the dawning Industrial Age, many people left the villages that were at
                            last being considered picturesque adornments to the country seat,
                            aggregating in cities larger than any built before. It would henceforth
                            be the task of democratic humanitarianism to ameliorate the conditions
                            of urban life through the institution of the public park, the Romantic
                            landscape of the common man. But before examining the further
                            manifestations of Romanticism in nineteenth-century landscape design and
                            the corresponding continuation and modification of the picturesque as a
                            viable style for private pleasure grounds and public parks alike, it is
                            necessary to look at two other approaches to the spiritual in nature,
                            those of <name type="place">China</name> and <name type="place"
                                >Japan</name>. As we have seen, the taste for Rococo <hi
                                rend="italic">chinoiserie</hi> in the eighteenth century brought but
                            a facile interpretation of Chinese garden style into Western currency.
                            We must therefore ask the question: What is the nature of Chinese and
                            Japanese landscape design?</p>

                                out in a line, nothing made level. The carpenter's line never
                                entered this place. Nature plants nothing by the line. The simulated
                                irregularities of the winding paths are artfully managed in order to
                                prolong the walk, hide the edges of the island, and enlarge its
                                apparent size, without creating inconvenient and excessively
                                frequent turnings." To this description, the author appends the
                                following footnote: "Thus these are not like those of these small,
                                fashionable groves, so ridiculously planned that one walks in
                                zig-zag manner in them and at each step must make a pirouette." See
